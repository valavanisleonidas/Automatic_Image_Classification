The plot tab indicates that 104 proteins (blue dots) were differentially expressed because they satisfied both the AC test and fold-change cutoffs specified by the user. 23 proteins (orange dots) did not meet the fold-change cutoff but were indicated as statistically differentially expressed, therefore deserving a second look. 267 proteins (green dots) met the fold-change cutoff; however, the AC test indicated that this happened by chance. 2293 proteins (red dots) were pinpointed as not differentially expressed between classes because they failed both the AC test and the fold-change cutoffs. The GUI also lists an AC FDR indicating that all blue dots satisfy the established user-selected FDR of 0.1.</CAPTION>

The page starts with a short legend followed by the different clones that were studied. This example shows the first clone ('et158'). The output lists the protein domains included in the insert and some gene specific information (more can be found in a separate list). The alignments are displayed in an image below: The target sequence is covered by three forward and one reverse sequences. Three further sequences could not be aligned to the target. The target gene is shown on top of this image as a grey bar with its coding sequence in blue. Below, the different sequences are plotted in different shades of grey with green parts representing the vector sequence. The sequence at the bottom is drawn in red to indicate that its orientation is reversed, i.e. that it was detected by sequencing from the 3' end and therefore determines the 3' end of the insert. The part of the gene that is actually covered by the sequences is emphasised with a box around it. Regions of the target gene not covered by sequences are marked with a thin red line on top of its bar and listed in the text. Protein domains are shown as horizontal purple bars reflecting their position in the cDNA. Below the figure, links to the raw data (sequences and BLAST results) are included.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>PET extraction using the Extractor module.  The process of PET extraction is initiated through the opening of 'Extractor' listed under the 'ToolSet'. Once a library is selected, library-specific parameters related to PET extraction will show up, such as spacer sequences and minimum/maximum PET length previously entered during library creation. Once the extraction parameters are confirmed or modified by the users, the DNA sequence file in FASTA format is browsed and uploaded. The 'sequencing center' accommodates different naming conventions for sequence IDs (used in input files) generated by different sequencing centers. The selection of a given naming convention method from the 'sequencing center' is needed for the system to properly parse individual sequences in groups of specific wells and plates for particular libraries. The user also needs to specify if the library is a GIS-PET or ChIP-PET library.</CAPTION>

The rise of fluorescence in the no-template control produces a melting point maximum at about 80 ° C, far lower than where  Fusarium  target are detected. Because melting curves presented in Figure 1B were recorded with low template amounts, the unspecific products are also visible, but they do not prevent the detection of  Fusarium  DNA in amounts equal to or higher than the limit of detection.</CAPTION>

(A)  Deduced amino acid sequence of the intervening loop sequence (residues 120 – 165) and portions of the immediately-adjacent TMDs (underlined) in p36. The numbers shown above individual amino acids indicate their relative positions in p36. Amino acids predicted to form an  α -helix (residues 131 – 157) are shaded grey and residues that are proposed to constitute the positively-charged face of the  α -helix are bolded. Secondary structure prediction was carried out using Jpred  . Numbers next to each amino acid residue shown in the  α -helical wheel projection correspond to their relative positions in p36 (residues 121 – 157) beginning at the N-terminal end of the predicted  α -helix. Positively-charged residues in the  α -helix are colored red.  (B)  Schematic illustrations of various p36-myc mutant proteins and their corresponding subcellular localizations in transformed (via biolistic bombardment) tobacco BY-2 cells. The numbers in the name of each p36 mutant denote the specific amino acid residues that were either deleted or replaced with glycine residues. Portions of the p36 ORF are colorized blue or black, the latter denoting the two putative TMDs in p36. Asterisks highlight the relative position of the cluster of positively-charged amino acids that were replaced with glycine residues. Grey boxes denote the C-terminal myc epitope. Cyt, cytosol; Mito, mitochondria.  (C)  Representative (immuno)epifluorescence micrographs illustrating the localizations of the various constructs shown in (B).

Cell viability by trypan blue exclusion is on the right, and measured apoptosis is on the left.  B , corresponding cathepsin activity in the AM media showed significant increases in cultures that were exposed to NB-2.

Panels in  D , show acridine orange-stained lysosomes in unstimulated cells, NS-exposed AM, early (1hr) NB-2-exposed AM and late (4 hr) NB-2-exposed AM, respectively. The NS-exposure appears to concentrate the lysosomes in the AM, whereas the NB-2-exposure initially causes reorganization of the lysosomes and subsequently depletes the lysosomes from the AM.

Six replicates of an oligonucleotide representing a fragment of the unmethylated CDKN2A promoter were amplified using the CDKN2A primers and QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit, then melted by increasing the temperature from 60 to 90 ° C, rising in 0.5 ° C increments, waiting for 30 s at the first step and for 5 s at each step thereafter, acquiring fluorescence at each increment. Raw fluorescence was plotted against temperature. The plots show that the magnitude of the starting fluorescence may vary significantly even between replicates. B) Graph of raw fluorescence plotted against temperature from one sample from Figure 1A shows that there are three distinguishable phases. In Phase 1 there is a linear decrease in fluorescence with increasing temperature (represented as a solid blue line). In Phase 2 there is a rapid reduction in fluorescence which is a combination of the linear decrease and the melting of dsDNA. During Phase 2 the observed fluorescence ( F(T)obs ) is less than the fluorescence expected from the Phase 1 alone ( F(T)max ). The reduction in fluorescence due to the melting of the dsDNA alone at any given temperature (vertical dotted red line) is the difference between  F(T)max  and  F(T)obs ,  F(T)melt  (solid red line with arrow heads). In Phase 3 the dsDNA is fully melted and there is no further decline in fluorescence. C) Normalised melt curves for the six replicates in Figure 1A. The normalised fluorescence was calculated by the formula  F(T)obs / F(T)max  at every given temperature increment. Normalised fluorescence expressed as a percentage was then plotted against temperature.</CAPTION>

The right chart plots un-trapped introns from the same genes and shows a reduction in the intrinsically disordered category.  B)  Consequences of GFP insertions: in cases where GFP insertions fall into predicted structural domains, mapping of domain sequence to known structures of proteins of the same fold shows that it is mostly surface exposed areas that are affected. In both examples, the overall fold of the GFP target domain is unlikely to be affected by the insertion. Note that the linker residues and the C-terminus of GFP (blue dotted lines) are predicted to be highly flexible. The displayed examples show only one possibility for how the GFP domain is structured relative to the host protein.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Phospholipids are hydrolyzed by phospholipase A 2  liberating arachidonic acid and Lyso-PAF, regulators of insect's immune system . Arachidonic acid is the substrate for eicosanoid production, prostaglandins via cyclooxygenase and leukotrienes via lipoxygenase. Lyso-PAF is acetylated by PAF-acetyl transferase releasing PAF that can be degraded by PAF-acetyl hydrolase that hydrolyses PAF regenerating Lyso-PAF. In the presence of dexamethasone the immune responses are inhibited due to the suppression of phospholipase A 2  activity with lower production of eicosanoids and PAF. On the other hand when exogenous arachidonic acid is added there is enhancement of eicosanoid production and immune responses increase.</CAPTION>

ABD quantifies the cardiac chamber areas instantaneously by detecting the blood-tissue interface (red line), which results in a continuous, beat-to-beat left ventricular area curve (green line). Left ventricular end-diastolic area (LVEDA) was defined as peak of the left ventricular area during diastole. Left ventricular end-systolic area (LVESA) was defined as minimum left ventricular area during systole. Stroke area (SA) was defined as LVEDA  –  LVESA over the same cardiac cycle.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Stop! In the name of transforming growth factor- β : keeping estrogen receptor- α -positive mammary epithelial cells from proliferating</TITLE>
<CAPTION>A hypothetical model of paracrine versus autocrine signaling in mammary epithelial cells. Normal mammary epithelial cells expressing estrogen receptor (ER) α  and progesterone receptor (PR) are restrained from proliferating, mediated by the growth-inhibitory actions of transforming growth factor (TGF)- β  signaling, active in this population. The steroid receptor-positive cells secrete local-acting growth factors to induce neighboring cells to divide in a paracrine fashion. In early breast cancer progression, this normal paracrine mechanism may switch to an autocrine loop, allowing steroid receptor-positive cells to proliferate, possibly through the downregulation of active TGF- β  signaling, leading to an upregulation of cell-cycle molecules such as cdc25A, cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)2.

<TITLE>HIV-1 TAR element is processed by Dicer to yield a viral micro-RNA involved in chromatin remodeling of the viral LTR</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Model for the generation and action of HIV-1 TAR derived miRNA . Basal transcription of the HIV-1 LTR produces short RNA transcripts containing the TAR element. These RNA elements are directed to the cytoplasm where they are processed by Dicer to yield a viral miRNA. This viral miRNA associates with the RISC or RITS complex and through homology to sequence contained in the viral RNA, as well as the proviral genome, may direct silencing of viral gene expression. Alternatively, the viral miRNA may contain sufficient homology to mediate silencing of cellular genes. Our work identifies a role for Dicer in the generation of an HIV-1 miRNA, but we cannot rule out the involvement of Drosha  in vivo . An alternate pathway for the generation of this miRNA is indicated by the dashed arrows. It should be noted that the two pathways may generate miRNA with slightly different sequence, as cleavage by the Drosha enzyme would eliminate some sequence from the base of the stem.</CAPTION>

Groups of homologous sequences are aligned and subsequently trimmed to remove gap-rich regions. The refined alignment is used to build a NJ tree, which is then used as a seed tree to perform a ML likelihood analysis as implemented in PhyML, using four different evolutionary models (five in the case of mitochondrially encoded proteins). The ML tree with the maximum likelihood is further refined with a Bayesian analysis using MrBayes. Finally, different algorithms are used to search for specific topologies in the phylome or to define orthology and paralogy relationships.</CAPTION>

The classical I κ B-NF κ B signaling cascade proceeds through the sequential phosphorylation, ubiquitination (ub) and proteosomal degradation of I κ B α  and the coordinate release and nuclear translocation of NF κ B. Hyper-activation of NF κ B in cancer can be overridden by hyper-activating RAR with retinoids. As such retinoid therapy induces malignant reversion but is associated with retinoid toxicity.

Proteomic assays are used to determine antibody specificity or measure changes in serum levels of cytokines or chemokines using multiplex assays. Cellular profiling assays are used to phenotype immune cells based on intracellular or extracellular markers using polychromatic flow cytometry.  In vitro  cellular assays can measure innate or antigen-specific responsiveness in cells exposed to immunogenic factors. Genomic approaches consist of measuring abundance of cellular RNA and also microRNAs that are present in cells or in the serum. Other genomic approaches consist of determining gene sequence and function (for example, genome-wide association studies, RNA interference screens, exome sequencing).</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Evolution and differential expression of a vertebrate vitellogenin gene cluster</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Syntenic arrangement of chicken, medaka, labrid and zebrafish vitellogenin ( vtg ) genes . White boxes represent coding  vtgs , while dot-boxes indicate pseudogenes. Data for chicken show the chromosomal loci (Mb) of complete type  vtgs  together with some of the linked genes. Syntenic data for three-spined stickleback, torafugu and spotted green pufferfish are similar to the medaka [ 7 ], and therefore not shown here. The genes are aligned (not to scale) to illustrate orthologies between the vertebrates. Arrows infer the likely direction of duplication or rearrangement. Labrid  vtgs  are shown on dashed lines since no genomic data are currently available for linkage maps. The ZfVTG1-8 cluster is preliminary oriented according to increasing bp loci and a BLAST hit for the Ssx2ip protein. The rearrangement of the genes to different chromosomes is consistent with their origin in protochromosome m [see [ 40 ]]. Linear representations of the sub-domain structures of each type of Vtg are shown for clarity.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>How many novel eukaryotic 'kingdoms'? Pitfalls and limitations of environmental DNA surveys</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Bayesian phylogeny of alveolates based on the analysis of 80 complete or nearly complete SSU rRNA gene sequences (1,325 positions), including 44 selected environmental phylotypes (indicated in bold). The number of phylotypes belonging to each of the five main alveolate lineages is indicated in brackets next to the clade name. Phylotypes previously considered as novel eukaryotic lineages, which are in fact fast-evolving members of known groups are highlighted in orange. Phylotypes that could be identified thanks to an increasing taxon sampling are highlighted in green. The tree is rooted with three stramenopile sequences. The GTR + G model of evolution was used, and the topology shown is a Bayesian consensus of 20,000 sampled trees (see text). The posterior probability of each resolved node is indicated. Branches are drawn to scale, except those marked with an asterisk (*), which were reduced by half for clarity.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Schematic diagram of LXR/RXR activation mechanism (adapted from the references cited above) . In the absence of a ligand, LXR/RXR heterodimers are bound to the LXREs in the promoter region of target genes and in complex with corepressors (SMRT or NCoR). Ligand binding (e.g., oxysterols) induces a dissociation of corepressors and recruitment of coactivators and the target gene expression is induced.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Overview of the integrated database-pipeline system . Rectangles represent computational applications, and are three in number. The Resource (A) contains gene-, SNP-, and disease-related primary resources and constructs a primary information database. The Automatic pipeline (B) retrieves information from primary databases and extracts essential gene-, SNP-, and disease-related data. We mapped disease terms and aliases, or gene names and aliases, based on the UMLS and HGNC databases. Also, disease terms were corrected for noun modification, stop word, and suffix. SNP effects were investigated by amino acid substitution; locations are available. The Diseasome (C) is a database including three categories of information (gene, SNP, and disease), and relationships among the three categories.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Chromatin, gene silencing and HIV latency</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Variation in the level of proviral expression within cell clones might be accounted for by the degree of methylation. In this model the degree of repression, set up at the time of integration, is critical to the degree of gene expression. Studies supporting this model include [36,47,49,50]. DNA methylation is an attractive candidate as a molecular correlate of repression and is depicted as such here and in Figure 2. There is, however, evidence suggesting that other molecular mechanism may be involved (see text).  (a)  Provirus integrated into repressive chromatin is stably repressed, probably correlating with a high degree of proviral DNA methylation.  (b)  Provirus in partially repressed chromatin is unstable and may proceed to become tightly repressed, or continue to be expressed but could be induced to a higher degree of expression. The change in epigenetic mark could arise from cell division.  (c)  Integration into permissive chromatin leads to high-level gene expression.</CAPTION>

Inhibition of DNA replication by nucleotide depletion or DNA damage, and unfired licensed origins trigger S phase checkpoint activation, whereas unreplicated centromeres could trigger the activation of the spindle checkpoint due to lack of tension at kinetochores. However unreplicated segments of DNA in non-centromeric sites and the presence of forks at natural protein-DNA complexes, like the RFB sites on rDNA genes, do not trigger a checkpoint response.</CAPTION>

In case of low stoichiometry as for the  in vivo  situation enrichment of phosphoproteins is necessary. To cope with this a novel enrichment procedure called metaloxide affinity chromatography (MOAC) is used in the strategy [18]. The whole approach is applicable to identify phosphorylation sites out of complex samples. The library of  in vivo  sites may be used for screening of protein phosphorylation dynamics using triple-quadruple mass spectrometry [6] .</CAPTION>

Pilot maps were built for each of the ten populations separately to flip the phase of loci assigned to the wrong phase, to identify multi-locus markers, and to remove loci and lines with excessive numbers of singletons (apparent double crossovers). The quality-filtered datasets were then used to build seven 'component' maps for individual populations with sufficient numbers of lines and loci. The integrated dataset of all ten populations was used to build a consensus map. The quality of the locus order of the consensus map was evaluated by comparison against the order of loci in the component maps and a 'synthetic map' derived from the component maps.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>The main categories of the General Formal Ontology (GFO) as outlined in [14, p. 70]. The basic distinction of GFO relevant for this work relates to items and is between individuals and categories. Individuals are items that cannot be instantiated. Categories are items that can have instances and may be predicated of other entities. The instances of categories of first order are individuals, while higher-order categories have categories as instances. For all items, the  instance-of  relationship is a relation of major importance, linking items (including categories) to the categories of which they are an instance.</CAPTION>

B) Complementary sequences of CODEHOP PCR primers derived from the "DMGL" motif. The sequence of the complementary strand of the primer is shown to identify the coding sequence. The actual PCR primer is the complement of the sequence. DMGLB was biased towards KSHV-like sequences by using the codons from the KSHV TS gene in the 5' clamp region of the primer with KSHV-specific nucleotides highlighted (3' region of the complementary coding strand shown). DMGLXB was predicted from the amino acid sequence block of the conserved "DMGL" motif using the CODEHOP software and utilizes the most common human codons for the amino acids in the 5' clamp region, and is unbiased in design. The underlined sequence in the 5' clamp region can form a stem-loop structure, shown in C. The CODEHOP PCR primer, DMGLX1B, is a revised version of DMGLXB to eliminate base pairing in the stem-loop structure by changing the highlighted cytosine (C) in Fig. 13-C. to an adenosine (A), boxed in Fig. 13-B.</CAPTION>

Gene names, Ups sequence type, domain architecture, chromosomal location, transcription orientation, and binding functions are listed. IT4  var  genes are primarily assigned to different groups on the basis of 5' flanking sequence (Ups type) and chromosomal location when known. PfEMP1 proteins are comprised of multiple domains termed N-termimal segment (NTS), Duffy binding-like (DBL), cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR), C2, transmembrane (TM), and acidic terminal segment (ATS or exon2) which have been classified by sequence criteria into different types. The PfEMP1 proteins in the 3D7 clone were arbitrarily classified into 17 different protein architectural types on the basis of domain composition [6]. Types 18 – 25 (bolded) are unique to IT4. Chromosome locations are indicated as T, ST, SST: first, second, and third  var  genes from the telomere respectively. C: internal  var  genes. t: transcribed towards telomere, c: transcribed towards centromere. The chromosomal location of  var2csa  was determined in [ 78 ].

<CAPTION>Carrier frequency comparisons of the different HLA-DRB1 allele groups between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cases and controls across the various Caucasoid and non-Caucasoid population samples and overall effect estimation. This figure provides a summary meta-analysis of allele carrier frequencies according to HLA-DRB1 allele classification, in selected samples among the data available from the 13th International Histocompatibility Working Group on Rheumatoid Arthritis. For each population sample, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) evaluate the significance of the association between the different HLA-DRB1 allele groups and RA susceptibility (blue boxes). The combined ORs and 95% CIs evaluate the significance of the global effect of the different HLA-DRB1 allele groups on RA susceptibility over all population samples.  P  values were calculated with the Mantel-Haenszel method (black diamonds).</CAPTION>

<TITLE>A multiple-method approach reveals a declining amount of chloroplast DNA during development in Arabidopsis</TITLE>
<CAPTION>A model for change in cpDNA and nuclear DNA (nDNA) amount during development . The change in parameters affecting cpDNA and nDNA amount between immature and mature tissues is represented. Two cell types are shown, along with the net change expected for a population of both cell types. Arrows indicate an increase or decrease. Dashes indicate no change. In Type 1 cells, cpDNA/plastid and plastids/cell are constant, and the nDNA increase leads to a decrease in cpDNA/nDNA. In Type 2 cells, cpDNA/plastid declines, but both plastid number and nDNA remain constant, leading to a decrease in cpDNA/nDNA. The net change for the population is an increase in nDNA, no change in plastids/cell, and a decrease in both cpDNA/plastid and cpDNA/nDNA.  Shaded boxes  indicate the parameters used to calculate plastomes/cell, based on qPCR and mean ploidy using flow cytometry. Data obtained from these methods represent the net change in nDNA and cpDNA/nDNA for the population and do not assess the cpDNA/plastid. The net increase in nDNA/cell is similar to the net decrease in cpDNA/nDNA because Type 1 cells contribute to the increase in ploidy without contributing greatly to the change in cpDNA/nDNA. As a result, calculation of plastomes/cell yields a similar value for immature and mature tissues, and there appears to be no net change in plastomes/cell (left half of the box in the bottom right corner). If qPCR and flow cytometry could be performed on each cell type separately, calculation of plastomes/cell would reveal no change for Type 1, a decrease for Type 2, and a net decrease for the population (right half of the box), because the contribution of individual cells to the increase in nuclear ploidy and decrease in cpDNA/nDNA could be assessed.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Variant populations present in plasma of infant macaques one week after oral challenge with SIVmac251-5/98 . RT-PCR and HMA analysis was performed on replicate samples to confirm reproducibility of the results. Three main transmission patterns were observed, labeled A (multiple variants; diverse virus population), B and C (one major homoduplex (Ho) with a few faint heteroduplexes (He); relatively homogenous virus population). One infant (31833) harbored a plasma virus population that had elements of both transmission patterns A and C. SIV251 V.S. indicates the SIVmac251-5/98 virus stock.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>MUSCLE: a multiple sequence alignment method with reduced time and space complexity</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Additive profiles.  The profile functions in MUSCLE require amino acid frequencies for each column. Here we show the alignment of two profiles X and Y, giving a new profile Z. Note that the count  n Z i  for amino acid  i  in a given column of Z is the sum of the counts in the child profiles, i.e.  n Z i  =  n X i  +  n Y i . In terms of frequencies, this becomes  f  Z i  =  N X f  X i  / N Z  +  N Y f  Y i / N Z , where  N X ,  N Y ,  N Z  are the number of sequences in X, Y and Z respectively. Therefore, given a suitable sequence weighting scheme, it is possible to compute frequencies in Z from the frequencies in X and Y. This avoids the step of building an explicit multiple alignment for Z in order to compute frequencies, as done in CLUSTALW and MAFFT.</CAPTION>

B) Visualization of an all-or-none interaction between the processes of binding site phosphorylation and  E  binding.  E  can only bind to phosphorylated sites, while the dephosphorylation of  D  is only possible in the absence of a bound effector. C) The cyclic reaction scheme degenerates to a reaction chain, as the species  D [0, 0,  E ] does not exist. In this case, the notation can be simplified by describing binding site phosphorylation and  E  binding as modifications of the same site.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Fibrosis in senescent rat choroid plexus.  Aging takes a toll on choroid plexus, functionally and structurally. This electron micrograph depicts massive collagen deposits in CP interstitium, i.e., between the vascular core and outer epithelial (E) ring. Fibrotic (F) bands in a 36-mo-old Brown-Norway/Fischer rat are 40 – 50 times thicker than corresponding collagenous layers in young adults. Excessive fibrosis likely impedes nutrient flow from plasma to ventricles and reabsorption of A β  peptide fragments from CSF. Fibrosis in aging and AD also occurs in the arachnoid [240]. Consequently, fibrosis interferes with CSF dynamics via multiple effects. Appreciation is extended to P. McMillan for electron microscopy. Scale bar = 2  μ m.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Whole-mount transmission electron micrograph of an LSEC treated with 100 nM dihydrohalichondramide for 1 hour, showing the dark nuclear area and surrounding extracted cytoplasm.  Note the presence of small cytoplasmatic areas of intermediated density within the fenestrated cytoplasm. In several of these areas a very peculiar structure could be observed, consisting of rows of fenestrae with increasing diameter, fanning out into the surrounding cytoplasm, connected to the small cytoplasmatic areas with their smallest fenestrae. These structures are suggestive of de novo fenestrae formation and we therefore named them "fenestrae-forming center" (FFC) [ 79 ]. Scale bar, 5  μ m.</CAPTION>
