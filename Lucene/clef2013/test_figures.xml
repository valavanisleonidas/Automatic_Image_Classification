<CAPTION>Screenshot of CN state comparison visualisation mode . The CN state comparison of 30 healthy subjects is reported. Only the CN state comparison of autosome chromosomes is shown. SNPs with a diploid state (CN state 2) in all samples are in black; SNPs with a CN state lower than 2 (deleted) in all the samples are in blue; SNPs with a CN state lower than 2 in only some samples are in yellow; SNPs with a CN state greater than 2 (duplicated) in all the samples are in red; SNPs with a CN state greater than 2 in only some samples are in pink; and SNPs that were simultaneously duplicated and deleted in different samples are in green. In this figure, a duplication (pink) common to some samples is highlighted by an arrow. The position of one of the SNPs belonging to the highlighted deletion is reported at the bottom of the window. In the figure, a "Probe data" window is also reported. This window can be opened by double-clicking on any SNPs/squares visualised, and it displays the intensity value and the genotype of all compared samples for that particular SNP.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>The interface of the PPEP for batch computation of Fisher's exact test of multiple gene lists and merging the result files for matrix of enrichment scores . From each species-specific database, multiple functional categories can be selected for batch computation. Users have options merging p-values for enrichment scores, merging ListHits (how many genes from the lists hit the term), or merging -log10 transformed FDR values into a matrix. As default, Fisher's exact test p-values can be floored by criteria of p>  0.05 and ListHits< = 1 to make the corresponding enrichment scores as 0. However, users have options to either not floor the enrichment scores, or set up their own customized way to do the flooring. Other options are also provided: e.g., computing FDRs or not, or number of iterations for FDR computations.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>The GOurmet Cartography Targetoid plotting window . Depicted is a screen shot where the sample GEP profile has been chosen as a center element (center elements are selectable in the dendrogram window), and all other profiles radiate outward in direct inverse proportion to how similar they are to GEPs. Note how GEPs are more similar to the other two stem/progenitor profiles and more distant from all the profiles of differentiated cells. Relationships among non-center elements are only approximately reflective of their similarity and are depicted by how far apart they are from each other ( θ  angle between elements in this polar coordinate system). Any profile can be selected as the center and, by multiply selecting different profiles, users can reconstruct all the direct relationships among the various profiles. A sliding bar allows the user to focus on certain regions of the targetoid space (important for visualization when large numbers of profiles are compared at once and many similar ones cluster closely together); users can also adjust the axial scale. The targetoid plot can be output as a jpeg.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Thermodynamics of weight loss diets</TITLE>
<CAPTION>A:  Oxidation of glucose in a calorimeter is completely inefficient. The products of oxidation are carbon dioxide and water, and all of the energy produced is released as heat.  1B:  To illustrate the proper interpretation of the first law of thermodynamics in living organisms we must consider that conservation of matter and energy includes excretion of products into the external environment. None of the products of oxidation (CO 2  and H 2 O) remain within the organism. There is stoichiometric balance and no net weight change. Only the ATP, representing the useful energy, is retained. The wasted heat constitutes 60% of the energy of oxidation, while the efficiency is reflected in the retained ATP, available for reactions in the organism. Body fat stores are signified as TAG (triacylglycerol)  1C . A common way of thinking of weight loss is from reduction of caloric intake. If our subject ingests 2.3 moles of glucose (or equivalent lipid and/or protein) and produces only 90 moles of ATP, then homeostasis will enlist body stores of fat (and/or lean body mass) to yield the additionally required 5 moles ATP. The additional resultant CO 2  and H 2 O (and heat) will be excreted (and radiated) leading to weight loss.  1D : If efficiency is reduced then our subject would have to eat more (e.g. 2.9 moles of glucose, or equivalent lipid/protein) to produce 95 moles of ATP and remain at the same weight. The additional CO 2  and H 2 O produced will be excreted maintaining constant weight.  1E : Under conditions of reduced metabolic efficiency (from 40% to about 38% in this example), 90 moles of ATP will be produced from oxidation of 2.5 moles glucose (or equivalent lipid/protein). The remaining 5 moles ATP needed for homeostasis must be made up from oxidation of body stores of lipid or lean mass. This results in weight loss, exactly as it does for the example of reduced caloric intake (Figure 1C).</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Ultrasound properties of articular cartilage in the tibio-femoral joint in knee osteoarthritis: relation to clinical assessment (International Cartilage Repair Society grade)</TITLE>
<CAPTION>The ultrasound system, typical ultrasound echo and wavelet map .  (a)  The ultrasound measurement system employed, consisting of a transducer, a pulser/receiver (i), a digital oscilloscope (ii) and a personal computer (iii). The system can be used with arthroscopy (iv, v), open surgery (vi) or a saline bath (vii) for experimental measurement. The ultrasound wave output from the transducer travels through the saline. The reflected waves return to the transducer and generate electrical signals that are proportional to their intensity.  (b)  Typical ultrasound echo (lower) and wavelet map (upper). The wavelet map was calculated from the ultrasound echo using wavelet transform. The first (left) of the two large-amplitude groups was the echo ( t  = 2.0  μ s: Group N) reflected from the cartilage surface, and the second ( t  = 3.9  μ s: Group K) was reflected from the subchondral bone (right). The signal intensity (as shown by the scale) of Group N is a measure of superficial cartilage integrity. The time interval between Group N and Group K is related to thickness and ultrasound speed of cartilage. The echo duration of Group N is a parameter related to the surface irregularity of cartilage.

<CAPTION>Apoptosis in blood dendritic cells (DCs) is induced by breast tumor-derived supernatants.  (a) Apoptosis in blood DCs was determined by Annexin-V binding and TUNEL assays following culture (24 h) in the presence of 50% (v/v) peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived supernatant (PBMC-SN) or tumor-derived supernatants (TDSN; MCF7, MB435, MA11 and SKBR3). Representative dot plots (SSC on y-axis versus apoptosis on x-axis) are shown with numbers indicating the percentage of apoptotic cells.  (b) Summary of apoptosis data. The proportions of Annexin-V +  and TUNEL +  blood DCs represent the average  ±  standard error of the mean of five independent experiments for which statistically significant differences compared to PBMC-SN are shown: *,  p<  0.05; **,  p<  0.01; ***,  p<  0.001.  (c) For morphological analyses (original magnification times 1,000), 50 cells were assessed in three separate fields. In contrast to PBMC-SN, cultures incubated with TDSN (MA11) frequently demonstrated features of apoptotic death in blood DCs (reduction in cell volume and nuclear size, cytoplasmic blebbing, cell membrane convolutions and formation of apoptotic bodies). Three independent experiments with similar findings were performed.</CAPTION>

We tested concentrations ranging from 0% octanol to 100% octanol on the species and found that  Panagrellus redivivus  did not avoid this noxious chemical to the same extent as the other species.  Caenorhabditis elegans  and  Cruznema tripartitum  displayed similar trends in avoidance and  Caenorhabditis briggsae, Caenorhabditis  sp. 3 and  Pristionchus pacificus  responded very similarly. Data for each species is represented as normalized avoidance index (see Methods for details). (B) Concentration curves for glycerol avoidance. Concentrations ranging from 0.1 M to 4 M glycerol were tested on the different nematodes. We found that  P. redivivus  showed least avoidance of glycerol at concentrations wherein the other species fully responded to glycerol. At the highest concentration tested,  P. redivivus  also responded strongly to glycerol. All the other species displayed similar avoidance of different concentrations of glycerol. Data for each species is represented as normalized avoidance index (See Methods for details). (C) Behavioral dendrogram for osmotic avoidance and octanol avoidance and its relation to the phylogenetic tree. The dendrogram was generated using hierarchical clustering for these two sensory behaviors. This data set incorporated all the different ablations done in the different species for the different behavioral assays. As expected  P. redivivus  and  C. tripartitum  exhibited the most different behavioral repertoire compared with the other species.

Blue arrows above the genome line represent TSSs from the FULL-Malaria database, while black arrows below the genome line are those that have been identified in other studies. Numbers above these arrows are the number of multiple TSS that could not easily be distinguished at the scale with individual arrows. In all cases, only one DNA strand is shown and directionality can be inferred from the direction of TSS arrows. The scale is given between the genome and the MAPP profile and is zeroed at the translation start site of the gene. In (c), the combined regions represented by the parentheses contain 47 individual TSSs. Those TSSs between the start codon and -80 nucleotides predominantly give rise to unspliced transcripts, while those in the region further upstream (to -172 nucleotides) give rise to correctly spliced mRNA.</CAPTION>

The anchors are aligned independently, and only the instances in which both align uniquely to the reference sequence are considered. Then, the alignments are extended as long as they still match the reference sequence. The SplitSeek program identifies all candidate junction reads from the split-read alignments where the boundary is located in the gap between the anchors. Then additional junction reads are detected from the set of reads that partly align to a previously detected candidate junction, and where the remaining, nonaligned, part of the read (grey lines) has a 5-bp identical sequence compared with the corresponding part of the same candidate read. SplitSeek then groups all potential junction reads, applies cut-offs, and reports the results.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Dissecting the transcriptional networks underlying breast cancer: NR4A1 reduces the migration of normal and breast cancer cell lines</TITLE>
<CAPTION>RT-PCR validation of differential expression of transcription factors identified in the differential tumour epithelial transcriptome .  (a)  Validation of 275 transcription factors that had been identified in the differential tumour epithelial transcriptome (DTET) to be deregulated in breast tumours was performed by RT-PCR. The first round of validation, where pools of normal and tumour RNAs were used, confirmed 24 genes to be deregulated in breast cancer. These 24 genes underwent a second round of RT-PCR validation in which RNAs from individual solid and F19-negative breast cancer samples were used. Genes deregulated in breast cancers were considered those showing differential expression in 50% or more of the F19-negative tumours compared with normal breast. The genes shown are the five transcription factors identified by the DTET and confirmed by two rounds of RT-PCR validation to be deregulated in tumours.  β 2 -microglobulin ( β 2 M) was used as a loading control.  (b)  Real-time PCR was performed for NR4A1 expression using RNA from normal breast, breast organoids and F19-negative tumours. Nine out of the 16 F19-negative tumours tested showed twofold or higher NR4A1 expression compared with normal breast (F19.1, F19.4, F19.5, F19.7, F19.8, F19.10, F19.12, F19.14 and F19.15).

<CAPTION>HIV-1 Gag attenuates SDF-induced CXCR4 downregulation in Jurkat T cells . (A) Jurkat T cells were pre-treated with cycloheximide, then incubated in the presence (filled squares) or absence (open squares) of SDF, PMA and ionomycin for the indicated times. At each time point, cells were lysed and analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an anti-CXCR4 polyclonal antibody. Western blots were quantitated and amount of CXCR4 remaining at each time point was determined as a percent of amount of CXCR4 at 0 hour. Data from one representative experiment (out of three) is shown. (B) Jurkat T cells were transduced with Gag-GFP encoding lentiviruses at the indicated MOIs. 48 hours post transduction, cells were analyzed for GFP fluorescence by flow cytometry. The % of GFP positive cells is indicated for each MOI. (C) A representative gel depicting CXCR4 levels in Jurkat T cells transduced with lentiviruses encoding wild-type Gag-GFP and treated as described in (A) is shown. Control represents untransduced cells. (D) Quantitation of the gel shown in (C). Additionally, degradation of CXCR4 in Jurkat T cells transduced with lentiviruses encoding LTAL Gag-GFP is shown. Error bars represent standard deviation between duplicates at each time point. (E) Jurkat T cells were transduced with lentivirus encoding LacZ (control), Gag-GFP or LTAL Gag-GFP. Data shown represents the mean  ±  SD of % undegraded CXCR4 remaining after 6 hours of incubation with SDF, PMA and ionomycin. (F) Cell surface levels of CXCR4 in Jurkat T cells expressing LacZ, Gag-GFP or LTAL Gag-GFP were determined 48 hours post transduction by flow cytometric analysis of cells stained with a biotinylated anti-CXCR4 antibody and Streptavidin-PE. Data shown represents the mean  ±  SD of surface CXCR4 levels relative to the control, from two independent experiments.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Screening procedure for the creation of new insertions and identification of lethal and sterile mutations .  (A)  P 1  cross: Mass-crosses were made between the donor (EGFP-marked eyes) and the helper strain (DsRed-marked eyes). The donor strain has an additional insertion site-dependent, muscle-specific enhancer-trap pattern.  (B)  P 2  cross: Single hybrid females carrying both the donor and helper elements (simultaneous expression of EGFP and DsRed) were crossed to three  pearl  males.  (C)  F 1  cross: A single individual carrying a stable new insertion was selected from the offspring of a P 2  cross and crossed to several  pearl  mates. A remobilization event was evident in beetles that still showed EGFP-marked eyes, but had lost the muscle-specific enhancer-trap pattern. Note the altered enhancer-trap phenotype of the new insertion line in this example (EGFP expression in the wings).  (D)  F 2  cross: All EGFP-marked offspring of the F 1  cross were heterozygous for the insertion and were sibling-crossed.  (E)  F 3  cross: Several single-pair matings were set up.  (F)  Test for lethality and sterility: Marker gene expression of the offspring of each single-pair mating was evaluated to determine whether their parents had been hetero- or homozygous for the  piggyBac  insertion (see Methods). Each single-pair mating was assigned to one of five classes (small black arrows; Table  4 ). The combined evaluation of all single-pair matings was used to define the phenotype of the insertion (see Table  5 ).  (G)  Summary of all identified insertions.

<CAPTION>Model for X inactivation in the female mouse embryo.  (a)  Sperm bearing an X chromosome (the paternal X or X p ) have epigenetic marks (blue flags), leading to transcriptional repression of a portion of the chromosome.  (b)  In the female embryo (XX) these marks carry over through fertilization and the first cleavages.  (c)  From the two-cell to the eight-cell stage, a separate mechanism establishes additional marks (red flags) on the paternal X, repressing transcription at most loci. The maternal X chromosome (X m ) is unaffected.  (d)  In the blastocyst, repression of the paternal X is maintained in trophectoderm cells that will go on to form the trophoblast (an extraembryonic lineage) but is lifted in cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) (which are fated to form the embryo proper), where X inactivation now occurs randomly (green flags).  (e)  This state is maintained through later development, in which the paternal X is inactive in extraembryonic lineages, but random X inactivation occurs in the embryo proper. In male (XY) embryos, which inherit only a maternal X chromosome, no silencing occurs through these mechanisms.</CAPTION>

(D)  Note that the Gsx1 expansion is delayed in  Gsx2;Ascl1  mutants at this stage but, as shown earlier, this recovers at later stages.  (E, F, H)  The proneural protein Ngn2 is normally expressed in pallial progenitors (E) but in the  Gsx2  (F) and  Gsx2;Ascl1  mutants (H) the ventral limit of Ngn2 expression (arrows in (F, H)) has expanded ventrally into the mutant LGE.  (G)  In contrast, the ventral limit of Ngn2 expression in  Ascl1  mutants (arrow) appears to be similar to that in wild type (E).  (I-P)  The status of Notch signaling can be assessed by the expression of  Dll1  and  Hes5 . In wild types,  Dll1  (I) and  Hes5  (M) are expressed in ventricular zone (VZ) progenitors along the dorsal-ventral axis of the telencephalon. As is the case in the wild types, Gsx2 mutants appear to express  Dll1  (J) and  Hes5  (N) throughout the telencephalic VZ, while the  Ascl1  mutants exhibit expression only in the dorsal telencephalon (K, O) corresponding with Ngn2 expression. Although the  Gsx2;Ascl1  mutants do not show  Dll1  (L) and  Hes5  (P) expression in the ventral-most telencephalon (that is, medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) remnant indicated by asterisk) these Notch effectors are expressed in the mutant LGE progenitors unlike the case in Ascl1 mutants.

<CAPTION>Increased A β 42 /A β 40  ratio reduced responsiveness of SH-SY5Y cells to RA and the knock down of up-regulated CRABP1 rescued their differentiation potential . Phase contrast images showing living human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y), grown on collagen coated glass cover slips and treated with 1 nM retinoic acid (RA). Differentiation was evaluated by the number, shape and length of outgrowing protrusions: (1A) C99I45F (A β 42 /A β 40 ↑ ); (2A) C99V50F (A β 42 /A β 40 ↓ ). Differentiation was evaluated after RA-treatment for 6 days. Both cultures were 50% confluent when RA was added (day zero). C99I45F reached 90 – 100% confluency after 4 – 6 days without any signs of differentiation, whereas C99V50F did not exceed more than 60 – 70% confluency (after 6 – 10 days) but showed strong differentiation. C99I45F was also evaluated at 60 – 70% of confluency showing no signs of differentiation (data not shown), thus strong confluency of C99I45F (shown here) does not conceal putative signs of differentiation. (B) C99I45F (A β 42 /A β 40 ↑ ): 30 nM siRNA was administered to the cells for 24 hours in combination with a treatment of 1 nM RA for 2.5 days. After 2.5 days, the effects of more than 50% knockdown of CRABP1 (2B) was compared with a nonsense sequence (negative control, (1B)). (C) C99I45F: same conditions as in (B) except that RA was administered for 4 days. Differentiation was evaluated after 4 days. Knockdown of CRABP1 (2C) was compared with a nonsense sequence (negative control, (1C)). (D) C99I45F: same conditions as in (C), but with another preparation from the same experiment as in (C).

The insertion site of the  Gpc4 LacZ  gene-trap allele has not been mapped, precluding development of an allele-specific PCR reaction to distinguish  Gpc4 LacZ/+  from  Gpc4 LacZ/LacZ  animals. However, since  Gpc4  is located on the X chromosome, males with a single LacZ allele are unambiguously hemizygous. Thus, the comparison in (L) is between wild-type (both sexes) and LacZ+ males. Note that  Gpc2 -/-  brains are not significantly different in size from wild type, nor does loss of  Gpc2  enhance the phenotype of the  Gpc1 -/-  mouse.

<TITLE>Analysis of dietary interventions. A simple payoff matrix for display of comparative dietary trials</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Payoff matrix for dietary comparisons . Matrices show (theoretical) paired comparisons: Weight loss (in kg) for each individual in the VLCKD is shown in rank order across the top of the matrix (X-axis). Weight loss for the LF is shown down the side of the matrix (X-axis). Each matrix element shows the difference between the value for the VLCKD (column) and the value for the LF (row):VLCKD-LF. Positive values indicate more weight loss for the VLCKD value than the LF, negative values indicate the reverse. Data are from reference [ 3 ] in which subjects were assigned to two diets with roughly similar caloric levels (VLCKD: 1855 kcal/d; LF: 1550 kcal/d) differing in nutrient composition: VLCKD = %carbohydrate:fat:protein = ~9:63:28, LF, ~58:22:20. After a fixed period (50 days for men; 30 days for women) subjects switched to the other diet. Data in the matrices are for performance in each phase. In the cross-over data, weight loss for each subject from the LF phase is subtracted from weight loss in the VLCKD phase (regardless of which came first in the experiment) and displayed in rank order.

<CAPTION>Amifostine activates the unfolded protein response-dependent signalling pathways . MCF7 and U87 cells were treated for increasing periods of time with 2 mM WR-1065 or 10  μ g/mL Tunicamycin (Tun) in complete culture medium. Proteins and mRNA were collected at several time points, and protein and gene expression were assessed by Western-Blot and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. (A) Amifostine differentially up-regulates  BIP ,  EDEM, GADD34 and CHOP  genes in MCF7 cells. Quantitative-PCR profiles of  BIP ,  EDEM ,  GADD34  and  CHOP  genes, in MCF7 cells treated with WR-1065. Results were normalized using  α -tubulin mRNA and expressed as ratios between the treated [aminoguanidine (AG)+WR1065] and untreated (AG alone) conditions. The time zero of the experiment is set to 1. (B) Amifostine triggers eIF2 α  phosphorylation in MCF7 cells. Western-blot analysis of total (Tot.eIF2 α ) and phosphorylated eIF2 α  (P-eIF2 α ) in MCF7 cells treated or not with 2 mM WR-1065. A 1 h treatment with 2 mM dithiothreitol was used as a positive control for eIF2 α  phosphorylation. Total protein extracts were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, and protein levels were assessed using specific anti-eIF2 α  and anti-P-eIF2 α  antibodies. (C/D) Amifostine-induced vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) up-regulation requires activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). MCF7 cells were transduced with a small interfering (si)RNA directed against ATF4 (SiATF4, white bars) or with the same siRNA mutated in three nucleotides (SiMUT, grey bars), used as control;. Transduced cells were treated for 24 h with AG alone (CTL) or in combination with 2 mM WR-1065. (C) ATF4 gene expression was assessed by real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). (D) VEGF-A gene expression was assessed by real-time RT-PCR. ATF4 and VEGF-A mRNA expression levels in amifostine-treated cells are expressed as fold changes to the control condition (AG alone), which were set to 1 for SiATF4 and SiMUT. Error bars correspond to standard deviations for each triplicate determination.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Celecoxib analogues disrupt Akt signaling, which is commonly activated in primary breast tumours</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Effect of the Celecoxib analogues on apoptosis induction. To follow the fate of the cells upon Akt inhibition, indicators of apoptosis were temporally measured. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and nucleosomal fragmentation were measured after 12 and 24 hours. The cells were treated with Ly294002 (30  μ mol/l), Celecoxib (50 or 100  μ mol/l), OSU03012 (5, 7.5, or 10  μ mol/l), or OSU03013 (5, 7.5, or 10  μ mol/l) and then the cell pellets were split for PARP and nucleosomal cleavage.  (a)  There was a dose dependent increase in PARP cleavage on treatment with OSU03012 and OSU03013 at both 12 and 24 hours. LY294002 similarly induced PARP cleavage but to a lesser extent. Celecoxib at 50  μ mol/l did not have sustained effects on PARP cleavage, whereas the high dose of celecoxib (100  μ mol/l) did.  (b)  The induction of apoptosis was secondarily analyzed by nucleosomal fragmentation. There was a dose dependent increase in nucleosomal fragmentation upon treatment with increasing concentration of either OSU03012 or OSU03013. Likewise, Ly294002 induced fragmentation of the nucleosomes at both time points. Celecoxib at 50  μ mol/l did not have such an effect. In contrast, high dose celecoxib did stimulate apoptosis. Each treatment was conducted in replicates of six on two difference occasions.  (c)  Impact of signal transduction inhibitors on cell survival. The MDA-MB-453 cells were exposed to Ly294002 (30  μ mol/l), celecoxib, OSU03012, and OSU03013 at the indicated concentrations and cell viability was assessed 24 hours later. OSU03012 and OSU03013 killed more than 90% of the cells with 10  μ mol/l of the respective inhibitors. Celecoxib at 100  μ mol/l had a similar effect, but celecoxib at 50  μ mol/l was not effective at reducing cell viability. This screen was conducted in replicates of four in three separate experiments.  (d)  The T47D cells similarly responded to the celecoxib analogues based on cell survival. Each experiment was performed in replicates of six on three separate occasions.  (e)  MDA-MB-453 cells were treated for 2, 4, 6, or 24 hours with Ly294002 and P-Akt was measured (top panel). A comparison was made with the MDA-MB-453 cells exposed to OSU03012 (10  μ mol/l) for 2, 4, or 6 hours. Total Akt was measured as a control for sample input.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Flux-sum intensification of competitive and uncompetitive metabolites . In the base case, the maximum biomass production can be achieved due to optimal distribution of carbon fluxes to all the biomass components. If we intensify the flux-sum of any of the competitive metabolites (red nodes), the metabolite would compete for the limited resources and perturb the optimal distribution of carbon fluxes, resulting in reduced biomass production. On the other hand, intensifying the flux-sums of uncompetitive metabolites (blue nodes) does not perturb the optimal carbon flux distribution while the flux-sum of fully utilized metabolites (orange nodes) cannot be intensified. It is obvious that all metabolites contributing to biomass production shown in the figure are both essential and competitive.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Knocking down  CSNK1E  induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and caspase-mediated apoptosis.  (a)  Two days after non-targeting shRNA or  shCSNK1E  treatment, HT1080 cells were fixed in methanol and stained with propidium iodide (Materials and methods). Flow cytometry of cells was performed on a FACSCalibur; calculation of cell cycle stages was performed using the cell cycle analysis program Modifit LT. Red area shows cell population in G1 or G2 cell cycle phase, while gray area shows dying cells. Label 'A' denotes apoptotic cell population. Insets show photographs of HT1080 cells treated with non-targeting shRNA or  shCSNK1E .  (b)  Knocking down  CSNK1E  down-regulates  CyclinB1  and  CyclinA2 . Cellular RNAs were prepared from HT1080 cells infected with either non-targeting shRNA (N.T.) or two different  CSNK1E -targeting shRNAs (1834, 1837), and real-time PCR was performed with each gene-specific primer set. The expression levels of  CyclinB1 ,  CyclinA2  and  CyclinD1  were first normalized to the level of an endogenous control ( RPLPO ), and then the relative expression level of each gene among the three cell lines was expressed as a ratio of transcripts in a cell line to those in non-targeted shRNA treated cells. Error bars indicate one standard deviation of triplicate data.  (c)  Knocking down  CSNK1E  induces caspase activation. Whole cell lysates from HT1080 cells infected with either non-targeting shRNA or  shCSNK1E  and cells treated with staurosporine were prepared. The cleavage of PARP1 or caspase-3 (Casp-3) in each sample was examined by western blotting using antibodies against PARP1 and cleaved caspase-3.</CAPTION>

Whereas expression of (b)  bunA  or (c)  Madm  singly does not cause a size alteration compared to the control (a), overexpression of both leads to increased eye size (d).  (e)  The size increase on  bunA  and  Madm  coexpression is due to larger ommatidia (Student's  t -test, n = 9, *** p<  0.001).

<CAPTION>Graphical representation of the results of correlation analyses in the Ensure and water cues groups . Collapsed values for the expression of each of the immediate early genes that were normalized to regional control averages were used to calculate correlations within each group so long as there was a significant mean difference between the groups for each individual gene. Correlations that were significant are color-coded by the range in which their Pearson product moment value (r) lies (see key). Correlations that were not significant are indicated by light gray shading. ( A ) Correlations between regional immediate early gene expression and total horizontal activity in the water cues group (left column) and the Ensure cues group (right column). ( B ) Correlations between regional immediate early gene expression and plasma corticosterone in the water cues group (left column) and the Ensure cues group (right column). ( C ) Interregional gene expression correlations in the water cues group (lower left half) and the Ensure cues group (upper right half). NA designates a region for which correlations were not performed due to a lack of significant differences between the groups in all of the genes analyzed. The lack of interregional gene-expression correlations within the diencephalon most likely represents a decrease in the statistical power of the correlation analyses, as only a subset of the genes exhibited significant differences in expression within these regions.

<TITLE>Particle length-dependent titanium dioxide nanomaterials toxicity and bioactivity</TITLE>
<CAPTION>The mechanistic basis for TiO 2  long nanobelt (NB-2)-induced toxicity to alveolar macrophages (AM) is lysosomal breakdown resulting in cathepsin B release .  A , panels illustrate the concentration-dependent cell death uniquely initiated by NB-2 exposure in the C57BL/6 AM. Cell viability by trypan blue exclusion is on the right, and measured apoptosis is on the left.  B , corresponding cathepsin activity in the AM media showed significant increases in cultures that were exposed to NB-2.  C , This is supported by the  in vivo  observation that cathepsins are significantly increased in the lavage fluid of mice 24 hours following NB-2 instillation (30  μ g/mouse). Panels in  D , show acridine orange-stained lysosomes in unstimulated cells, NS-exposed AM, early (1hr) NB-2-exposed AM and late (4 hr) NB-2-exposed AM, respectively. The NS-exposure appears to concentrate the lysosomes in the AM, whereas the NB-2-exposure initially causes reorganization of the lysosomes and subsequently depletes the lysosomes from the AM. ( E ), similar patterns were visualized using a fluorescent cathepsin B substrate under identical assay conditions as in ( D ). The NS-exposure appears to concentrate the cathepsin B in the AM, whereas the NB-2-exposure depletes the cathepsin in the exposed AM. Data expressed as mean  ±   SEM . Asterisk ( * ) indicates  P<  0.05, double asterisks ( ** ) indicates  P<  0.01, and triple asterisks ( *** ) indicates  P<  0.001 compared to baseline or control production levels.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Conserved intron positions in ancient protein modules</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Experimental set-up to determine the effect of intron presence on the ancientness of the sequence it is in.  A . The number of identical splice site residues was varied between 2 (one residue on both sides of the intron position) to 10 (2*5). The maximum number of 10 represents then a perfect match of 10 residues around a splice site. As an indication of sequence ancientness, the number of matching residues further up- and downstream was calculated. The maximum number that can be reached is 20 (10 on each side) representing a perfect match in this region.  B . Control situation that described the setup with identical parameters but without an intron. All sequence comparisons in this control were thus performed relative to a virtual splice site (intron position).  C . Example sequences that have respectively 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 fixed identical sequences at each end of their splice site (in red). The fixed identical sequences around the splice site are shown in bold red. Identical residues further up- and downstream of the splice site that are used to determine general homology of the sequences are shown in bold black characters.  D . Similar results as in C, using sequences without a splice site. Shown are sequences with 6 and 10 identical residues around the virtual splice site.</CAPTION>

Attention is focused on selected aspects of the system, e.g., leukocyte interactions with the flow chamber surface. (A)  a : each small shaded domain represents experimental measures of a specific in vitro characteristic or property such as distance rolled. The degree of shading illustrates different levels of experimental and measurement uncertainty.  t : these are members of the set of  targeted  in vitro attributes that the in silico model is expected mimic. The shaded circle contains the much smaller set of observable, measurable attributes of a foundational in silico analogue, such as the ISWBC. (B) The sketch illustrates the systematic, sequential extension of the foundational analogue's attributes to improve model-referent phenotype overlap. Circle #1: The set of attributes targeted by the ISWBC in A (the foundational analogue). Circle #2 (shaded): The targeted attributes (represented by circle #1) have been expanded to include two new attributes; however, ISWBC #1 fails to generate behaviors similar to the two newly targeted attributes, resulting in its invalidation. A copy of the ISWBC is iteratively refined (without losing or breaking the original behaviors) by adding new detail only as needed (or by replacing an atomic component with a composite component) until successful coverage of the expanded set of targeted attributes is achieved. Oval #3 (dotted): The analogue represented by circle #2 is to be improved: one new attribute is added to the set of targeted attributes in 2, and the process just described is repeated.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Genome adaptation to chemical stress: clues from comparative transcriptomics in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and  Candida glabrata</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Global comparison of the  S. cerevisiae  and  C. glabrata  chemical stress responses based on DCA and MatrixREDUCE analyses .  (a)  We analyzed 718 orthologous gene pairs for which at least one gene displayed a change in expression in response to benomyl stress using the DCA method [ 10 ]. The DCA cluster pairs of orthologous genes according to their expression in each species (see Additional data file 3 for a complete description of the DCA method).  S. cerevisiae  was used as the 'reference' yeast whereas  C. glabrata  was used as the 'target' yeast. Eight clusters were obtained after primary hierarchical clustering using the  S. cerevisiae  expression profiles. Each cluster was then split into two subclusters (labeled 'a' and 'b') after secondary hierarchical clustering using the  C. glabrata  expression profiles. Gene expression profiles are indicated with a color code [ 80 ]: green for down-regulated genes and red for up-regulated genes. Based on the mean correlations between gene expression levels within and between 'a' and 'b' subgroups, eight conservation clusters were defined: three clusters displaying 'full conservation' (clusters 2, 7 and 8); three clusters displaying 'partial conservation' (clusters 1, 3 and 6); and two clusters displaying 'split conservation' (clusters 4 and 5). The biological relevance of these clusters is discussed in Additional data file 4.  (b)  Three pairs of PSAMs identified with the MatrixREDUCE algorithm [ 31 ] and that exhibited significant Pearson correlations (r>  0.6) are shown in the panel on the left. They correspond to specific regulatory sequences that are evolutionarily conserved between  S. cerevisiae  and  C. glabrata . The panel on the right shows the frequency of occurrence of PSAM in 50 bp windows of the gene clusters identified with the DCA. Background genomic frequency is indicated in black (dashed line); the frequency in conserved parts of DCA clusters is indicated in red (clusters 1b, 2 and 3b for down-regulated genes, and clusters 6b, 7 and 8 for up-regulated clusters); and the frequency in non-conserved parts of DCA clusters is indicated in yellow (clusters 1a, 3a and 4 for down-regulated genes, and clusters 5 and 6a for up-regulated clusters). Together, the DCA and MatrixREDUCE results allowed the identification of a set of orthologous genes whose expression and regulation is conserved between the two species examined here.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Power of grammatical evolution neural networks to detect gene-gene interactions in the presence of error</TITLE>
<CAPTION>An overview of the GENN method . First, a set of parameters must be initialized in the configuration file. These parameters specify details for the evolutionary processes. Second, the data are divided into 10 equal parts for 10-fold cross-validation. Third, training begins by generating an initial population of random solutions using sensible initialization, which guarantees functional NNs in the initial population. Fourth, each newly generated NN is evaluated on the data in the training set and its fitness recorded. Fifth, a selection technique that is specified by the user is used to select the best solutions for crossover and reproduction in the evolutionary process. The cycle begins with the new generation, which is equal in size to the original population. This cycle continues until either a classification error of zero is found or a limit on the number of generations is reached. After each generation, an optimal solution is identified. At the end of GENN evolution, the overall best solution is selected as the optimal NN. Sixth, this best GENN model is tested on the 1/10 of the data left out to estimate the prediction error of the model. Steps two through six are performed ten times with the same parameters settings, each time using a different 9/10 of the data for training and 1/10 of the data for testing. At the end of a GENN analysis, 10 models are generated  –  one best model from each cross-validation interval. A final model is chosen based on maximization of the cross-validation consistency of variables/loci across the ten models.</CAPTION>

A) A-425619 inhibits currents activated by half maximal concentrations of either capsaicin (1  μ M) or protons (pH 5.5) with similar efficacy (20.1 vs. 25.9 nM). Co-application of these same concentrations of capsaicin and acidic pH results in a significant rightward shift in the IC 50  of A-425619 (704 nM). Reducing the capsaicin concentration to 100 nM (near the EC 75  under acidic conditions) or 30 nM (~EC 35 ) shifts the IC 50  of A-425619 back to the left (63.6 and 23.2 nM respectively). B) Schild plot of the effect of A-425619 at different capsaicin concentrations. The resulting data points were fit with a linear regression with a slope of 1.13 and a pA 2  value of 47.9 nM. The linear relationship is consistent with the results that show acidic conditions increases the affinity of capsaicin for the TRPV1 channel and that A-425619 is a competitive antagonist at the capsaicin site.</CAPTION>

The two plots show the average reflectance spectra for all the colour blocks included in the study on the red charts, for two of the printers used in the experiments. The top chart shows a 'good' printer, which produced a printed chart with approximately even spacing between the blocks with increasing R-values. This contrasts strongly with the bottom chart, produced from a different printer, which shows an uneven spacing between the spectra, and a 'bunching' of spectra at low and high R-values, meaning that the even spaces in RGB space did not correspond to an even spacing in spectral intensity.</CAPTION>

Cells were treated with ionophore for 3 min before mounting and fixation as described in Methods. The epifluorescence image in the inset shows the DsRed-cav distribution (cytoplasmic) which was not affected by the Ca 2+  ionophore. When the cytoplasmic area was analysed, (a) as shown by the area within the red line, both orange and green/blue areas are seen indicating the presence of both GFP-PKC and quenched GFP-PKC  –  note that only GFP lifetime can be observed in the lifetime images. This indicates that DsRed-cav was sufficiently close to the PKC-GFP to induce a quenching of the GFP by the DsRed, i.e. the PKC is translocating to caveolin containing areas. By contrast, in the nucleus (b) only GFP-PKC was expressed and the lifetime was unquenched (~2.2 ns). This is the same as the lifetime for GFP-PKC when only the latter is expressed (see Figure 2).

<TITLE>Microtubules regulate disassembly of epithelial apical junctions</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Depolymerization of microtubules attenuates disassembly of the AJC in calcium-depleted SK-CO-15 cells.  In fully polarized SK-CO-15 cells cultured at normal concentration of extracellular calcium, AJ proteins E-cadherin and  β -catenin and TJ proteins occludin and ZO-1 are localized at areas of cell-cell junctions producing a characteristic 'chicken wire' pattern. In vehicle treated cells, 1 h of calcium depletion leads to translocation of junctional proteins from areas of cell-cell contacts into centrally-located ring-like structures. The microtubule-depolymerizing agent nocodazole (30  μ M) prevents disassembly of the AJC and cytosolic translocation of junctional proteins. Bar, 10  μ m.</CAPTION>

(b)  A fusion of the fission yeast genes  his7  (a phosphoribosyl-AMP cyclohydrolase) and  his2  (a histidinol dehydrogenase) to produce the budding yeast  his4  gene, which is involved in histidine biosynthesis. The budding yeast gene appears to combine the functions of the two fission yeast genes [35].  (c)  The fruit fly gene  Aats-tyr  is a tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (Flybase annotation) [36]. It is a probable recombination product of a predicted worm methionyl-tRNA synthetase gene  mrs-1  (WormBase annotation) [37] and a second worm gene  Y105E8A.19  of unknown function.  (d)  C. elegans  gene  ceh-20 , which encodes a homeodomain protein. This gene appears to be the result of a domain exchange between the  Drosophila  genes  exd  ( extradenticle , also a homeodomain protein) and  Pkg21D  (cGMP-dependant protein kinase).  (e)  E. coli  b4343, a hypothetical protein apparently formed via a domain exchange between  Salmonella  genes STY4850 (annotated as a DEAD-box helicase-related protein) and STY4851 (hypothetical protein). The numbers in the recombinant gene box are amino-acid positions in the protein product, indicating the portion of the protein derived from each of its 'parental' proteins.</CAPTION>

Non-permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-BST-2 antibody to reveal cell surface tetherin, followed by fixation and permeablization to visualize intracellular proteins. HIV-1 Vpu (untagged) was used as a positive control for tetherin removal from surface and visualized with an anti-Vpu antiserum, while the SIV Vpu-EGFP proteins and EGFP control were visualized using anti-GFP antibody. Both HIV-1 and SIVgsn Vpu proteins removed human tetherin from the cell surface, but SIVmus and SIVmon did not. Vpu-expressing cells are arrowed. (B) HeLa cells were transfected with a control EGFP expression plasmid alone or together with HIV-1 Vpu, or with each of the SIVmus/mon/gsn Vpu-EGFP expression plasmids. Cells were stained with anti-BST-2 antibody and analyzed by FACS.

Aliquots of the nuclear extracts of TNF- α -activated fibroblast-like synovial cells (FLS; 10 ng/ml TNF- α  for two hours) were incubated without (-) or with the indicated unlabelled oligonucleotides in the competition assays. The DNA-binding was reduced in the presence of cold nuclear factor kappa B (NF κ B) probe, but not with NF κ B mutant or AP1 oligonucleotides. An anti-NF κ B p65 antibody induced a supershift. Data are representative of three separate experiments.  (b)  Advanced glycation end products-modified (AGE)-BSA, but not control-BSA (Co-BSA) treatment results in NF κ B activation and the formation of NF κ B-DNA complexes. Nuclear proteins isolated from AGE-BSA treated FLS in the presence of a receptor for AGEs (RAGE)-neutralising antibody showed a weaker NF κ B binding in comparison with AGE-BSA stimulation alone. This demonstrates that the AGE-induced NF κ B activation was caused by AGE-RAGE interactions. The specificity of NF κ B binding was confirmed by supershifts using the NF κ B p65 antibody. The shown electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) is representative of two independent experiments with similar results.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Behavioural experiments on alarm pheromone effect when puffed just after the  Cimex lectularius  male mounted a female . The male mating behaviour is regulated by nymph-emitted pheromone cues only. (a) Frequency of male mounting on females with covered methathoracic glands did not differ between the five experimental groups ( n  = 27-30; Kruskal-Wallis test:  χ 2  = 5.322,  P  = 0.256) before puffing. (b) Stimulation with a male [5:4] ( n  = 19) or a female [1:1] ( n  = 20) ratio of ( E )-2-hexenal:( E )-2-octenal did not significantly alter the percentage of male mating with these females, compared to control. However, stimulation with either the nymph-specific ratio of these aldehydes [2:5] ( n  = 23)) or 4-oxo-( E )-2-hexenal ( n  = 22) caused a significant decrease in percentage of mating (Kruskal-Wallis test:  χ 2  = 35.602,  P<  0.001; followed by Mann Whitney U-tests).</CAPTION>

Panels (a) and (f) are embedded time series data from the  x -component of the H é non system with the addition of 1% and 10% observational noise (respectively). The remaining panels are representative ATS time series. Panels (b), (c), (d) and (e) are surrogates for panel (a), and Panels (g), (h), (i) and (j) are for panel (f). Each surrogate is computed with a different level of transition probability  P . In panels (b) and (g),  p  = 0.2; in panels (c) and (h),  p  = 0.4; in panels (d) and (i),  p  = 0.6; and, in panels (e) and (j),  p  = 0.8. In each case the attractors reconstructed from the surrogates have the same qualitative features as that of the data  –  with the possible exception of panel (e). The likely reason for this noted exception is the relatively high transition probability ( p  = 0.8) and the relatively low noise level (1%). Of course, for smaller values of  p  (i.e.  p  = 0.1) the similarity is even more striking.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Proposed pathway for the discharge of immature thymocytes from thymuses of E 2 -injected female B6A mice . The top diagram  (A)  depicts the typical thymocyte maturation pathway, beginning with the sub-capsular entry of prothymocytes into the cortex and the expression of Thy-1. Maturation continues through CD3 - CD4 - CD8 -  triple negative (TN) stages and the development of the T cell receptor (TcR). Subsequent expression of CD3 produces CD3 + CD4 -  CD8 -  double negative (DN) cells with  α β  TcR. After expression of CD4 and CD8, the CD4 + CD8 +  double positive (DP) cells undergo the process of positive selection. Surviving DP cells pass through the corticomedullary junction into the medulla. Here, they are transformed into CD4 +  (SP) and CD8 +  (SP) T cells, and in the process, autoreactive T cells are eliminated. Mature SP T cells then exit the thymus at the corticomedullary junction. The bottom diagram  (B)  shows how the E 2 -induced increase in vascular permeability is proposed to affect thymocyte maturation. Thymocytes, rather than expressing CD4 +  and CD8 +  and continuing into the medulla, exit the thymus at the corticomedullary junction. Maturation into SP T cells then takes place in the sinusoids of the liver.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Quantitation of PB2, NA and NS vRNA (A) and mRNA (B) in cells infected with the wild-type (WT) or NSNA virus at different postinfection time points. Uni-12 primer (0.2 ng/ μ l) [35] was used for the cDNA synthesis of vRNA, whereas oligo dT 20  (25  μ M) was used to generated cDNA of viral mRNA. In a typical reverse transcription reaction, 0.5  μ g of DNase-treated RNA sample was mixed with 1  μ l of the corresponding primer, 4  μ l of 5x first stand buffer, 2  μ l of 0.1M dithiothreitol, and 1  μ l of 10 mM deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (Strategene), 150 U of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase in a 20  μ l reaction. For detecting NA and NS RNA species, RNase-treated cDNA was examined by 5'-nuclease-based assays in a 7300 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Briefly, 5  μ l of the corresponding diluted cDNA samples were mixed with 12.5  μ l superMix-UDG (Invitrogen), 0.5  μ l of Rox reference dye, 1  μ l of 10 mM forward primer, 1  μ l of 10 mM reverse primers, 1  μ l of 10 mM probe and 4  μ l of water. Reactions were first incubated at 50 ° C for 2 min, followed by 95 ° C for 10 min. Reactions were then thermal-cycled for 45 cycles (95 ° C for 15 sec, 56 ° C for 1 min). Primers used in the NA detection assay were 5'-ACCGACCATGGGTGTCCTT-3' (corresponds to nt 870 – 888 of the NA cRNA) and 5'-GAAAATCCCTTTACTCCGTTTGC-3' (complementary to nt 998 – 1020 of the NA cRNA). Primer used in the NS detection assay were 5'-TACCTGCATCGCGCTACCTA-3' (corresponds to nt 277 – 296 of the NS cRNA) and 5'-ATGATCGCCTGGTCCATTCT-3' (complementary to nt 378 – 397 of the NS cRNA) were used. The probes used in the NA and NS assays were 5'-FAM-CGTCCCAAAGATGGA-NFQ-3' (corresponds to nt 950 – 964 of the NA cRNA; FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; NFQ, nonfluorescent quencher) and 5'-VIC-CACTGGTTCATGCTCA-NFQ-3' (corresponds to nt 327 – 342 of the NA cRNA; VIC, a proprietary dye), respectively. For the quantitation of PB2 RNA species, cDNA samples were amplified by using FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche) in a LightCycler platform (Roche). In a typical reaction, 5  μ l of RNase-treated cDNA was mixed with 2  μ l master mixtures, 1.6  μ l of MgCl 2 , 1  μ l of forward primer (5'-CCGCAGTTCTGAGAGGATTC-3', corresponds to nt 2090 – 2109 of PB2 cRNA), 1  μ l of reverse primer (5'-TCCGTTTCCGTTTCATTACC-3', complementary to nt 2226 – 2245 of the PB2 cRNA) and 1.6  μ l of water. Reactions were first incubated at 95 ° C for 10 min, followed by a thermal-cycling (95 ° C for 10 sec, 58 ° C for 5 sec, 72 ° C for 15 sec; 40 cycles). The specificities of the amplified products were all confirmed by melting curve analysis. In all the PCR assays, serially diluted plasmids containing the corresponding sequences were used as standard controls. All the data were derived from three independent assays. The levels of mRNA and vRNA from the studied mutants were analyzed by two-tails paired t-test.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>The expansin superfamily</TITLE>
<CAPTION>A common method for measuring the cell-wall extension activity of expansins.  (a)  Cell-wall specimens are excised from the growing region of a young seedling that has been grown in the dark (etiolated). The specimens are frozen and thawed in order to destroy the cells but leave the cell walls intact (the cuticle is abraded to facilitate penetration of proteins). The specimens are heat-treated to inactivate endogenous expansins and then clamped under constant tension in an extensometer. The extensometer measures the change in length of the sample, with or without the addition of exogenous expansins. Walls may be collected in parallel from other seedlings and extracted to obtain fractions with expansin activity, assayed as an increase in cell-wall length.  (b)  Photograph of a typical cell wall sample, placed on an index finger for scale, prior to clamping in the extensometer.  (c)  Time course for irreversible wall extension (creep) of heat-treated walls with and without the addition of expansin.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Relative predictive power of functional and physical protein networks. (a) Median values of predictive power (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve [AUC] ) across 100 loss-of-function phenotypes are plotted versus the median fraction of each seed gene set covered by a network (coverage; measured as the fraction of seed genes with at least one linkage in the network). Five networks are compared: the functional yeast network (YeastNet v. 2 [24]) and four versions of the network of yeast physical protein interactions (Database of Interacting Proteins [DIP]  [45], Probabilistic Integrated Co-complex [PICO]  [29], Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences [MIPS]  physical complexes [44], and Collins and coworkers [43] ). DIP, PICO, and YeastNet are each evaluated at two reported confidence thresholds. The YeastNet functional gene network shows considerably higher predictive power than for the networks composed only of physical interactions; the full YeastNet shows higher predictive power than a more confident core set of the top 47,000 linkages, indicating that the lower confidence linkages nonetheless add predictive power. Error bars indicate the first and third quartiles. Panels b and c show example seed gene sets (green circles) and their network connections, indicating functional linkages in grey lines, physical interactions in thin black lines, and both functional and physical interactions in thick black lines.  (b)  Genes whose deletion increases cellular chitin levels [33] (AUC = 0.87), whose prediction relies upon a mix of physical and functional interactions.  (c)  Genes whose deletion confers sensitivity at 5 generations in synthetic complete medium lacking threonine [4] (AUC = 0.65), whose prediction derives predominantly from functional linkages.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Synthesis of rhodamine B dye (RB) conjugated Gd-dendrimers and fluorescence microscopy of rhodamine B conjugated Gd-dendrimer uptake in cultured RG-2 glioma cells versus in RG-2 glioma cells of harvested RG-2 glioma tumor specimens . A) Synthetic scheme for production of rhodamine B dye conjugated Gd-dendrimers. Rhodamine B and DTPA are conjugated to the naked dendrimer terminal amines via stable covalent bonds. In functionalized dendrimers, approximately 35% of the terminal amines are occupied by Gd-DTPA, and approximately 7% of the terminal amines are occupied by rhodamine B. B)  In vitro  fluorescence microscopy of cultured RG-2 glioma cells incubated for 4 hours in media containing either rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G2 dendrimers (left), rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G5 dendrimers (middle), or rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G8 dendrimers (right) at a concentration of 7.2  μ M with respect to rhodamine B. Scale bars = 20  μ m. Rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G2 dendrimers enter RG-2 glioma cells, and in some cases, the cell nuclei (left). Rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G5 dendrimers (middle) and rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G8 dendrimers (right) enter the cytoplasm of RG-2 glioma cells, but do not localize within the nuclei. C) Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI-based Gd concentration curves of RG-2 glioma tumor tissue over time following the intravenous bolus of 0.06 mmol Gd/kg of rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G5 dendrimers (n = 6) and rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G8 dendrimers (n = 2). There is substantial extravasation of rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G5 dendrimers across the BBTB, which is more pronounced than that of Gd-G5 dendrimers across the BBTB. There is also some extravasation of rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G8 dendrimers across the BBTB, which is not the case for Gd-G8 dendrimers. D)  Ex vivo  low power fluorescence microscopy of RG-2 glioma tumor and surrounding brain tissue harvested at 2 hours following the intravenous bolus of rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G5 dendrimers. There is substantial accumulation of rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G5 dendrimers within tumor tissue, and some in surrounding normal brain tissue (left, T = tumor, N = normal, scale bar = 100  μ m). High power image of RG-glioma tumor shows subcellular localization of rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G5 dendrimers within individual RG-2 malignant glioma cells (upper right, scale bar = 20  μ m). H& E stain of tumor and surrounding brain (lower right, scale bar = 100  μ m). Tumor volume is 31 mm 3 . E)  Ex vivo  low power fluorescence microscopy of RG-2 glioma tumor and surrounding brain tissue harvested at 2 hours following the intravenous bolus of rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G8 dendrimers. There is some minimal accumulation of rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G8 dendrimers within brain tumor tissue (left, T = tumor, N = normal, scale bar = 100  μ m). High power confirms there is some minimal subcellular localization of rhodamine B conjugated Gd-G8 dendrimers within individual RG-2 glioma cells (upper right, scale bar = 20  μ m).

<CAPTION>Induction of apoptosis with T0901317 treatment . Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis was utilized for determination of caspase-3 and -7 activities. CaOV3 cells were treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or T0901317 at the indicated doses (10  μ M to 40  μ M) for 24 hours and then stained with Vybrant FAM dye, and 7-AAD strictly following manufacturer's instruction. Data are mean  ±  SD of three different experiments (A). Caspase 3/7 activity was also measured in CaOV3 cells after 12 hours of treatment with vehicle (DMSO) or 5  μ M, 10  μ M, 20  μ M, 40  μ M or 50  μ M. A luminescent assay was used, as detailed in Material and Methods. T0901317 significantly increases Caspase 3/7 activation. Results are the mean  ±  SD of three independent experiments and are expressed as percentage of negative control (DMSO). (* p<  0.006 vs. negative control, (B). The activation of caspase 3 was confirmed by Western Blot analysis. LXR agonist treatment enhances caspase 3 activation, resulting in increased caspase 3 precursor cleavage rate and decreased caspase 3 precursor protein levels. Decreased caspase-3 precursor protein levels occur in a concentration dependent manner (C).  β -actin expression was determined by Western blot analysis and used as an endogenous control.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Gene expression program emerging from the YMC . (a): The periodic genes of the YMC are grouped according to KEGG pathways (see Fig. S2 in Additional file  1 ) and then in the 15 macrocategories shown. For each macrocategory we calculate the average phase, HL, pulse width, and correlation of the periodic genes (in blue), and also the average HL and correlation of all genes (in red). Sorting by phase reveals the expected concatenation of events of the yeast gene expression program, especially in the first part with transcription preceding protein synthesis and DNA replication, followed by the slower categories of central metabolism. (b): Comparing HL and phase (or pulse width) roughly the same type of direct proportionality still appear. The trend in the average profiles of each category (black thick lines in (c)) reflects to a large extent that of Fig. 1. The third plot in (b) shows that also phase and pulse width are directly correlated: pulses that are delayed are also broadened. Linear regression for these plots is discussed in Additional file  1 .</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Carrier frequency comparisons of the different HLA-DRB1 allele groups between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cases and controls across the various Caucasoid and non-Caucasoid population samples and overall effect estimation. This figure provides a summary meta-analysis of allele carrier frequencies according to HLA-DRB1 allele classification, in selected samples among the data available from the 13th International Histocompatibility Working Group on Rheumatoid Arthritis. For each population sample, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) evaluate the significance of the association between the different HLA-DRB1 allele groups and RA susceptibility (blue boxes). The combined ORs and 95% CIs evaluate the significance of the global effect of the different HLA-DRB1 allele groups on RA susceptibility over all population samples.

Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using the city-block distance metric. The name of each strain is shown, along with the source of the strain (UTI, urinary tract infection; CF, cystic fibrosis respiratory infection; env, environmental isolate), and the rank order virulence of each strain as determined in panel a (1, most virulent; 20, least virulent). Strains with indistinguishable virulence were given a tied rank order (also see Table 2).  (c)  Presence or absence of PA14 virulence genes in additional isolates. Data for each strain tested is presented in columns. Strains are arranged in order from left to right in order of decreasing virulence, in the same order as shown in panel a; column headers refer to the 20 strain numbers used in Table 2. Columns with no gaps between them represent groups of strains with indistinguishable virulence (strains 4 and 5; strains 8, 9 and 10; and strains 14, 15 and 16).

Receptor binding efficiencies of gp120s were determined using a cell surface-binding assay in which bound protein was detected by Western blot analysis as described in Materials and Methods. Binding to CXCR4 was performed in the presence of sCD4 to expose the coreceptor binding site. HIV-1 IIIB  and HIV-2 SBL  gp120 exhibited relatively high CD4 binding efficiencies but weak CXCR4 binding. HIV-2 ROD  gp120 exhibited relatively weak binding to CD4 and relatively high binding to CXCR4. Numbers indicate mean band intensity following subtraction of background pcDNA3 lane intensity.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Analysis of marginal and basal cell barriers in  Slc26a4 +/+  and  Slc26a4 -/-  mice. Tight junctions were visualized by F actin in whole-mounts of stria vascularis. Bright field images were taken to evaluate pigmentation ( a ,  d  and  g ). Note the intact marginal cell ( b ) and basal cell ( c ) barriers in  Slc26a4 +/+  mice. Minimal pigmentation of  Slc26a4 +/+  mice did not compromise F actin localization. Whole-mounts of stria vascularis from  Slc26a4 -/-  mice were viewed either from the basal cell side ( e-f ) or from the marginal cell side ( h-i ). Bright field images verify that the same area was viewed from either side ( d  and  g ). Focus was varied to either visualize the marginal cell barrier (SMC,  b , e  and  h ) or the basal cell barrier (BC,  c , f  and  i ). Both the basal cell ( f ) and the marginal cell ( h ) barriers appeared to be intact. Blockage of the laser by pigmentation produces the untrue impression of 'holes' in the marginal cell barrier ( e ) or basal cell barrier ( i ). Comparison of images is aided by marking three significant areas with colored  stars . Bars = 10  μ m.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Tamoxifen promotes invasion of E-cadherin deficient MCF-7 cells .  (a)  MCF-7 cells were left untreated (control, 'C') or treated with transfection lipid ('L'), non-targeting (scrambled) siRNA ('NT') or E-cadherin-specific siRNA ('CDH1') for 72 hours before assessing their invasive capacity in oestrogen-free and tamoxifen-containing medium. siRNA-mediated suppression of E-cadherin expression alone promoted an increase in cell invasion through Matrigel. Inclusion of tamoxifen in CDH1-treated cells resulted in a further increase in invasive capacity. The graph is the mean of three separate experiments. *p<  0.01 versus CDH siRNA treatment.  (b)  MCF-7 proliferation was determined in response to E2  ±  tamoxifen and fulvestrant in the presence and absence of E-cadherin. Data demonstrated that these cells were responsive to both E2 and anti-oestrogens irrespective of E-cadherin presence. *p<  0.05 versus E2 alone.  (c)  The growth of untreated MCF7 cells or cells treated with lipid (L), non-targeting siRNA (NT) or CDH-1 siRNA (CDH1) over five days was determined by coulter counting. No treatment significantly affected cellular growth over this time period.  (d)  MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with siRNA  ±  tamoxifen and changes in their invasion determined. Tamoxifen did not have any significant effect on MDA-MB-231 cell invasion.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Larger about-weekly than about-daily cycle in electrical potential of a unicellular alga ( Acetabularia Acetabulum  evolved 500 million years ago). Nonlinear spectral analysis on signal averaged data from 20 single cells, released (zero time) into continuous light (LL), after prior standardization in light and darkness alternating at 12-hour intervals (LD12:12) for up to one week. Total number of observations: 38,578; experimental span: 376 days. Note a more prominent amplitude (A) for a component with a period near a week thanks the As of the about daily and about half-weekly components (all free-running). The circaseptan A is equated to 100 and the other As are expressed as percentage of the circaseptan. Meta-analyzed data of Dr Sigrid Berger, Dr L ü bbo von Lindern and the late Dr Hans-Georg Schweiger. The about-7-day (circaseptan) component is more prominent than the circadian rhythm in the electrical potential of a eukaryotic unicell released into continuous light after prior exposure to a light-dark schedule alternating at 12-hour intervals [ 187 ]. Models such as  Acetabularia  may help to better understand circaseptan and circadecadal components (both demonstrated for  Acetabularia ) and still broader chronome organization. Along with even older cyanobacteria that also show circaseptans [ 15 ],  Acetabularia  may serve to explore the origins of life, another topic of inquiry into the chronomes of our evolution and even into the chronomes of our cosmoi in the broadest sense for which organisms can serve as transdisciplinary radiation detectors.  Acetabularia  [ 292 ], like air bacteria and staphylococci [ 293 ], also serves as a laboratory model for circadecadal rhythms.</CAPTION>

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were purified from normal human donors (n = 3), transferred to cell culture dishes, and treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or LXR-623 (2 uM) for either 24 or 48 hours. Following incubation, cells were lysed and protein extracts were separated on SDS-PAGE and blotted with antisera raised to ABCA1, ABCG1, or actin (to serve as an indicator of protein loading per lane). Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were bound to the immobilized protein/antibody complexes, and proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence. Duplicate lanes for each treatment reflect the two different donors analyzed in this experiment. Molecular masses were estimated by the relative mobility of protein markers run in an adjacent lane on each gel.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Same patient as on Fig. 18 with changed brace pattern . After 6 months of treatment with a Gensingen brace ™  4C the lumbar curve was reduced, however the thoracic curve had increased by 5 ° . This is why we decided to change the brace to a Gensingen brace ™  3C in order to get rid of the rib shift on the concave side against the thoracic re-compensation. This is to show that sometimes it is not clear from the very start which brace may be the best for the patient. Today we address the primary curve at first and risk an increase of the counter curve when a patient is imbalanced. This allows having the best possible cosmetic result at the very end; however in this patient, there was no more change of cosmetics. The patient, nevertheless, is satisfied cosmetically and refuses surgery.</CAPTION>

HA-JDP2 expressing mice responder line was generated in the pBIG bi-cistronic expression plasmid under the regulation of tetracycline response elements. The promoter co-regulates the expression of the  β -galactosidase reporter together with HA-JDP2 protein. tTA-responder mice express the tetracycline activator (tTA) under the control of Liver Activating Protein promoter (LAP). tTA is expressed specifically in hepatocytes. The association of the tTA with the DNA is prevented in the presence of doxycycline thus results in shut-off transgene expression.  B . Mouse tail genotyping by PCR was performed with specific oligonucleotides corresponding to the tTA driver (tTA, right panel) and JDP2-transgene (JDP2, left panel).

<CAPTION>CBFA2T3 gene structure and promoter methylation patterns.  (A) CBFA2T3 encodes two alternative transcripts, CBFA2T3A and CBFA2T3B. CBFA2T3A is encoded by exons 1A and 2 – 12. CBFA2T3B is encoded by exons 1B-12 splicing out exon 3. Relative exon sizes are shown. The exon 1A start site contains no CpG island. The black box marks the location of a high-density CpG island located five prime to the exon 1B start site. The black arrowheads mark the primers used for real-time RT-PCR. (B) CBFA2T3B contains a CpG island of approximately 160 CpG sites spanning 1-kb of sequence. The single black bars represent CpG sites scaled relative to each other. CAT ELISA promoter constructs and primers used for MSP, real-time MSP and bisulfite sequencing are shown. The asterisk marks the location of the amplicon and internal primers used for second-round real-time MSP. (C) CBFA2T3B promoter methylation patterns were examined in hypermethylated cell lines using sodium bisulfite sequencing. A characteristic sinusoidal pattern of approximately six high to low frequency methylation levels every 40 – 150 bp was detected. The high-frequency cytosine methylation levels residing within a consensus Sp1 binding site located approximately minus 450 bp from the transcriptional start of exon 1B are shown.</CAPTION>

B) Visualization of an all-or-none interaction between the processes of binding site phosphorylation and  E  binding.  E  can only bind to phosphorylated sites, while the dephosphorylation of  D  is only possible in the absence of a bound effector. C) The cyclic reaction scheme degenerates to a reaction chain, as the species  D [0, 0,  E ] does not exist. In this case, the notation can be simplified by describing binding site phosphorylation and  E  binding as modifications of the same site.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Dental eruption in afrotherian mammals</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Distribution of CCD-like characters on mammalian phylogeny . Potential CCD-like features of Afrotheria optimized on a mammalian phylogeny [44]. Data on age at eruption are not yet known for small afrotherians (tenrecs, golden moles, sengis) or aardvarks. Based on the metric data presented in Figure 2 and in the text, we predict that when such data are available, age at complete cheek tooth eruption in small afrotherians will greatly postdate age at female sexual maturity (corresponding to long, horizontal red lines in elephants, hyraxes and manatees). Ages at completion of dental eruption in  Trichechus  and  Petrogale concinna  are arbitrarily set at the end of their recorded lifespan, reflecting the fact that these animals continually erupt supernumerary teeth. Dotted vertical lines represent 1.0 ratio of age at complete dental eruption/age at female sexual maturity (red, scale at bottom) and possession of 19 thoracolumbar vertebrae (blue, scale at top). Boxes at the center represent characters relating to phenotype observed in at least some afrotheres and human CCD patients, as follows: AN, unfused and projecting anterior nasal (black); MS, unfused metopic suture (black); PF, palatal fenestrae (black); CL, absent clavicles (black); TC, non-descended testicles (black), abdominal and ascrotal testicles (gray), scrotal testicles (white); VN, vertebral number (20 or more, black; 19 or less, white); DE, delayed eruption (after twice age at female sexual maturity, black; at or near female maturity, white). Scandentia, Dermoptera and Pholidota are not included owing to lack of data on dental ontogeny. Ages at female sexual maturity are taken from [45] except where indicated in Additional file  1 . Vertebral data for sea cows represent averages from [49].  Petrogale  is coded based on  P. concinna  for age at complete dental eruption and  P. penicillata  for thoracolumbar vertebral number owing to the lack of intact skeletons of the former in available collections.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>DNA breaks as triggers for antigenic variation in African trypanosomes</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Model for homologous-recombination-mediated double-strand break repair and  VSG  switching. Center, a double-strand break (scissors) within the 70 bp repeats (yellow bar) at the active expression site initiates a search for a homologous repair template. Telomeric (T 2 AG 3 ) repeats are indicated by the black arrowheads. Top, a silent telomeric  VSG  (up to 250 are available) can be copied into the active expression site via a gene-conversion cassette mechanism or by break-induced replication extending to the end of the chromosome. The longer stretches of 70 bp repeats found at these loci may increase the likelihood that these tracts are recognized and invaded by the broken strand at the active expression site. Bottom, replacement by a silent array  VSG  must use a cassette mechanism. The synthesis-dependent strand-annealing model [ 25 ] favors the type of recombination illustrated rather than crossover between silent  VSG  arrays and expression sites.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Loss of Vsx2 allows various cell types to develop in the retina . (A-J) Cryosections of 80 hours post-fertilization (hpf) retinas labelled with different cell-specific markers show that Vsx2 morphant retinas have all cell types present: Sox2 labels amacrine and M ü ller cells (A, B); protein kinase C (PKC) β 1 labels some bipolar cells (C, D); Hermes labels ganglion cells (E, F); Islet 1 labels horizontal, bipolar, some amacrine and ganglion cells (G, H); glutamine synthetase (GS) labels M ü ller cells (I, J). (K-T)Cryostat sections of 80 hpf transgenic retinas similarly reveal presence of all marked cell types in Vsx2 morphants. (K-N) Vsx2 morphant Tg( ath5:Gap-GFP ) retinas (double labelled with the ganglion cell marker Zn5 in red) still have green fluorescent protein (GFP)- and Zn5-labelled ganglion cells and form an optic nerve to the tectum. (O-R) Vsx2 morphant double transgenic Tg( vsx1:GFP-vsx2:dsRed ) have both GFP- and DsRed-labelled cells, but appear to have comparatively fewer Vsx2:DsRed cells. As in the control transgenics, Vsx1:GFP and Vsx2:DsRed do not co-localise in the same cells. (S, T) Vsx2 morphant Tg( ptf1a:GFP ) retinas show GFP labelling for horizontal and amacrine similar to that in controls, although some GFP cells are displaced and can be found closer to the lens in the GCL of the morphant retinas. L, lens. Scale bar: (A-T) 47  μ m.</CAPTION>

Postnuclear supernatants (PNS) prepared from parental AtT-20 cells or those stably overexpressing calnuc-GFP or calnuc( Δ SS)-CFP were analyzed by immunoblotting.  (A)  Endogenous calnuc (63 kD) is found in approximately equal amounts in the cytosolic (S) (100,000  ×  g supernatant) and membrane (P) (100,000  ×  g pellet) fractions. Calnuc-GFP (91 kD) is present in both fractions but is more abundant (~80%) in the cystolic fraction. Most (79%) of the mutant calnuc( Δ SS)-CFP (89 kD) is in the cytosolic (S) fraction.  (B)  The distribution of POMC, intermediate, glycosylated ACTH (gACTH) and mature ACTH is similar in parental cells (NT) cells and in cells overexpressing calnuc-GF (CNG). A small amount of ACTH is found in the cytosolic fraction of cells overexpressing calnuc-GFP, presumably due to leakage during preparation of the fractions. Synaptobrevin 2 (Vamp 2), an integral membrane protein, is found exclusively in membrane fractions. 90% of the G β  subunits and 80% of the G α i1/2 and G α i3 are found in membrane fractions in parental (NT) cells. A faint band of slower mobility is seen in the case of G β  subunits in the soluble fraction of CNG cells.</CAPTION>

(A), (B) Sets of time lapse images of the testis base, expressing the sneaky-GFP transgene [ 20 ], were projected together to show the relative movement of the acrosome bundles of a cyst inside the testis. Each frame is labeled with a specific false color as per the list shown in (B). The blue arrows and arrowheads point to the positions of acrosome bundles in the first frame while the white arrows and arrowheads indicate the final position. The arrows indicate the compacted set, which is likely to belong to the post-individualization stages, while the arrowheads indicate the acrosomes of the elongating/pre-individualization stage spermatids. (A) The compacted acrosome bundle (arrows) found near the base of the testis remain confined in the region as indicated by the positions of the blue and white arrow. Some acrosomes (green arrow) are occasionally found to move away from the bundle. This is considered to belong to the defective sperm that are lost during coiling. In comparison the acrosomes of the elongating spermatids (arrowheads) are loosely organized and move rapidly towards the testis base as evident from the positions of the blue and white arrowheads.

<TITLE>Acidification of rat TRPV1 alters the kinetics of capsaicin responses</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Prolonged exposure of TRPV1 to acidic pH produces a time-dependent change in the deactivation rate of capsaicin-activated currents . Single pulse protocols were used to determine time dependent differences in the deactivation of capsaicin currents following prolonged exposure to acidic pH. A) Co-application of acid (pH 5.5) and capsaicin produced sustained currents independent of the duration of application. TRPV1 channels were activated by 1  μ M capsaicin for 4 s, followed by 8 seconds of capsaicin + pH 5.5. The time dependence (1 – 8 s) of the sustained current is shown below and illustrates the reproducibility of the responses, the lack of desensitization and the parallel deactivation time-courses. B) Deactivation time constant of capsaicin response is decreased if acidic conditions persist after capsaicin application is terminated. Note the slow decline in current amplitude following removal of capsaicin, and the relatively faster deactivation rates of deactivation with longer intervals of acid pH application, presumably due to fast deactivating acid responses (see figure 2) contributing a greater proportion of the total current.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Relating tissue specialization to the differentiation of expression of singleton and duplicate mouse proteins</TITLE>
<CAPTION>A schematic illustration of concepts described in the text.  (a)  Proteins illustrating different aspects of phyletic age/time of duplication in the mouse proteome, when the calibrated time is the transition from unicellularity to multicellularity. 'A' represents the appearance of a protein in the mouse proteome, and 'D' is a duplication event, leading to the retention of both copies in the mouse proteome. The appearance of a novel protein relates to events where protein contains a novel combination of domains or to events where a protein sequence was changed beyond the recognition of traditional sequence search algorithms, and therefore there is a high likelihood that the protein performs a new function. Pre-metazoan mouse proteins are proteins that have descended from a protein present in the unicellular ancestor of mouse; metazoan-specific proteins are proteins that are unique to the multicellular lineage of metazoa. Because all duplications of metazoan-specific proteins are bound to take place after the transition to multicellularity, proteins from this group are not classified into groups of time of duplication (preMD/postMD).  (b)  Building a cumulative expression profile for protein families. The cumulative expression profile of each family was built by recording all tissues in which at least a single family member is expressed. Singleton proteins, by definition, are single member families and the cumulative distribution is identical to the protein distribution. Family A is an example of complementary expression with no expression overlap between the duplicate proteins; family B is an example of identical expression; and family C is an example of complementary expression with partial expression overlap. The protein cartoons used in this figure are only illustrative. postMD, post-multicellularity duplicates; preMD, pre-multicellularity duplicates.</CAPTION>

Top : The interstitium ( i.e ., loose connective tissue outside the blood and lymph vessels) in normal tissue consists of interstitial fluid and a solid extracellular matrix (ECM) again consisting of collagen fibers, glycosaminoglycans,  i.e ., hyaluronan and proteoglycans and fibroblasts. Notice the lymphatic vessel that is filled and drains filtered fluid and immune cells.  Bottom : The interstitium in tumors is more disorganized than in normal tissue, and tumors have a so-called reactive stroma. A normal stroma in most organs contains a minimal number of fibroblasts, whereas reactive stroma is associated with an increased number of fibroblasts, enhanced capillary density and irregular blood vessels that have high microvascular permeability, again resulting in extravasation of plasma proteins such as fibrin, which in turn attract an influx of fibroblasts, inflammatory cells and endothelial cells. Compared with non-neoplastic tissue, the tumor stroma contains increased amounts of collagen having variable fiber size, proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, especially hyaluronan and chrondroitin sulfate. Tumors have lymphatics, at least in the periphery, but lymphatics may be compressed (pictured as a flattened lymph vessel) and thus nonfunctional.</CAPTION>

The 5 α  series of C 27  bile alcohol, C 27  bile acid, and C 24  bile acid structures are illustrated with examples of animals (if any) whose major bile salts are in these classes. The structures are the stem structures for each of the three major classes of bile salts. Multiple enzymes are involved in the transition indicated by arrow A. The enzymes responsible for 5 α -reduction of bile salt precursors are currently unknown. If 5 α -bile salt pathways are homologous to 5 β  pathways, the reaction indicated by arrow B would be carried out by CYP27A1. Side-chain cleavage (arrow C) is likely a peroxisomal reaction in most or all animals. Arrow D covers all the possible additional modifications to stem bile salt structures (e.g., additional hydroxylation of the nucleus or side-chain, introduction of oxo groups, unsaturation of the side-chain, etc.).</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Platelet function and Isoprostane biology. Should Isoprostanes be the newest member of the Orphan-ligand family?</TITLE>
<CAPTION>A schematic representation of the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway . After its liberation by phospholipases, ((i.e., phospholipase A 2  (PLA 2 ) or phospholipase C (PLC)), the free arachidonic acid may undergo enzymatic metabolism by the lipoxygenases which produce HPETEs and leukotrienes, and the cyclooxygenases (COX-1, COX-2) which generate prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The specific repertoire of the arachidonic acid metabolites produced may vary according to the expression profile of these enzymes in different cell types. In platelets, for example, arachidonic acid is metabolized by COX-1 into the prostaglandin endoperoxides, PGG 2  and PGH 2 . Next, thromboxane synthetase further metabolizes PGH 2  into TXA 2 , which is a potent activator of platelet aggregation, with a half-life of 20-30 seconds. Thromboxane A 2  is then hydrolyzed to the inactive form TXB 2  (not shown). On the other hand, if PGH 2  is metabolized by prostacyclin synthetase, then PGI 2  would be produced (e.g., in endothelial cells). Furthermore, if PGH 2  is acted upon by PGD or PGE isomerase, then PGD 2 , and PGE 2  are produced, respectively (e.g., in renal cells). Finally, if the PG reductase metabolizes PGH 2 , then PGF 2 α   is produced (e.g., pulmonary vessels). Thus, the biological functions of arachidonic acid are exerted indirectly after its metabolism into prostaglandin and thromboxane metabolites.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Platelet function and Isoprostane biology. Should Isoprostanes be the newest member of the Orphan-ligand family?</TITLE>
<CAPTION>A schematic representation of the metabolic cascade for the non-enzymatic generation of isoprostanes . This is a proposed scheme in which four series of regioisomers of PGG 2  are formed, before they are reduced to PGF 2 α   isomers. As shown, isoprostanes can be formed from arachidonic acid in situ in phospholipids, from which they are presumably cleaved by phospholipases A 2 . PGG 2  spontaneously rearranges to PGD 2  and PGE 2  thereby generating isoprostanes of the D and E series. The initial step in the formation of an isoprostane from arachidonic acid  (I)  is the generation of a lipid free radical by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from one of the three methylene-interrupted carbon atoms, C7, C10, or C13, as shown here, by a free radical (FR • ) which may be a hydroxyl radical (HO • ), a superoxide radical (O 2 - • ) or other free radical, and results in  (II) . Radical attack at C-10 is shown, abstraction at the other positions determines the relative proportion of the isomers formed. The lipid free radical is converted to a peroxy radical by reaction with molecular oxygen. The peroxy radical cyclizes in an intramolecular reaction that yields an endoperoxide  (III) . The free radical chain reaction will continue to propagate until quenched by an antioxidant.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Recent advances in biomedical applications of accelerator mass spectrometry</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Schematic diagram of an accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) . Cesium (Cs) sputter ion source ( A ) contains the wheel with the graphite samples under high vacuum. Atomic Cs vapor is produced from a heated Cs reservoir and sprayed on to a heated ionizer surface, producing Cs +  ions that are accelerated towards the target held at -8 kV. The Cs +  ions sputter carbon atoms and ions from the target that are ionized to C -  ions as they pass through a condensed Cs layer on the cathode. Negative ions at  m/z  13 ( 13 C - ) and 14 ( 14 C - ) are pulsed through an injection magnet or low energy mass spectrometer ( B ) into a tandem electrostatic accelerator ( C ). Negative C -  ions are accelerated towards the high-voltage terminal (+518 kV) in the center of the accelerator where they are converted to positive ions, C +  being the most abundant. The high-energy ion beam is focused to collide with argon gas electron stripper or a thin carbon foil, 0.02 – 0.05  μ m thick ( D ) in a collision cell. Molecular charged ions such as  13 CH -  and  12 CH 2 -  do not survive the electron stripping process and are converted to atomic species, and  14 N -  ions decay on a femtosecond time-scale. The positive ions are repelled toward the high-energy exit of the accelerator held at 0 V.  13 C +  and  14 C +  ions are separated by momentum using a high-energy analyzing magnet or mass spectrometer ( E ). The beam currents of relatively abundant  12 C and  13 C are measured with Faraday cups ( F ). The  14 C beam is focused by a quadruple and electrostatic cylinder analyzer and the atoms are counted in a gas ionization detector ( G ). The advantage of a gas ionization detector is that it measures energy loss in terms of  Δ E / E  which facilitates isotope separation. It is possible to optimize the detector to the energy-loss separation of the isotope.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>The nuclear envelopathies and human diseases</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Nuclear envelope breakdown and reassembly in mitosis . At the end of G2, the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases, including CDK1, triggers entry into mitotic prophase. The nuclear membrane breaks down, and the NE-associate proteins either translocate to kinetochores, distribute with the fragmented ER networks, or dissolve in the cytoplasm. During NE reassembly in anaphase, SUN1 and LAP2 first appear around the condensed chromatin, though at different regions. The nuclear lamins then join the nuclear periphery in telophase. This figure illustrates the important roles played by the NE and the nuclear lamina in normal mitosis.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>A scheme of the proposed DNIC circuitry activated by noxious electrical or formalin stimulations . Both noxious stimuli at the hindlimb can excite projection neurons in the corresponding spinal dorsal horn (DH) to activate descending inhibitory systems (e.g. noradrenergic pathway, NA) in the supraspinal structures to inhibit the noxious excitability in different spinal segments, e.g. the tail. In comparison, noxious formalin and electroacupuncture (EA), which is a low-intense electrical stimulation and may not be DNIC-mediated, produces analgesia through NA- and opioid-dependent actions (left upper panel), whereas the analgesic effect of noxious electrical stimulus may not depend on activation of opioid receptors (opioid-independent, right upper panel).

<CAPTION>Schematic illustration of the 5-CSRTT used in the present experiment . Rat was placed in the center of the chamber. A trial started with the illumination of magazine until rat made a nose-poke response. After a delay (the intertrial interval, ITI), the stimulus light was presented over the hole in pseudorandom order. If an animal respond with a nose-poke into the illuminated hole within a limited hold of 5 s, a pellet was delivered into the magazine. An ITI began when the food pellet was retrieved, with the next stimulus light presented after the ITI. A period of time-out would be followed by an incorrect response with the house-light on for 5 seconds, during which no stimuli were presented. After a timeout, the rat could start a new ITI by nose-poking to magazine. Analyses of measures were based on the formulations as indexed.</CAPTION>

In normal cells, DNA damage arises from exposure to environmental fctors including reactive oxygen species, radiation or chemicals. This damage can be readily repaired by the DNA repair machinery. On the other hand, the incorporation of Progerin (brown lines) in the nuclear lamin network (green lines) alters nuclear morphology, resulting in defective nuclear processes for the maintenance of telomere length and DNA damage responses. In Progerin-expressing cells, accelerated aging ensues.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Classic bull's eye EM with initial misdiagnosis as urinary tract infection . A 78 year old women presented to an urgent care center with 3 days of fever, mild headache and the absence of rhinitis, cough or typical upper respiratory viral symptoms. The physical exam showed a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit and a skin rash was not noted. Urinalysis showed 5 – 10 WBCs, a diagnosis of pylonephritis was made, and ciprofloxacin was initiated. The patient returned the following day when she noticed a large, red rash on her side. The patient was referred to one of the authors (JA) who confirmed the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Ciprofloxacin was discontinued, doxycycline initiated and the rash resolved. Serology returned with a positive ELISA and confirmatory western blot.</CAPTION>

'T1' and 'T2' are technical terms describing the time required for proton relaxation. T2 images make adipose tissue, water, and other fluids bright, thus these images are ideal for detecting tissue edema. On the image, note the intact flexor hallucis longus (filled arrowheads) pulled taught. The flexor hallucis longus is responsible for what little plantar flexion the patient had left. The arrows show the retracted and limp proximal end of the Achilles tendon, with the bright area of signal intensity (open arrowhead) representing inflammation and fluid migration between the severed ends.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>A novel method to identify cooperative functional modules: study of module coordination in the  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  cell cycle</TITLE>
<CAPTION>The workflow of cooperative module identification and correlated genes identification . The input of the process is the weighted physical interaction (WPI) constructed in the first step of our methodology (Figure 1A). Steps 1, 2, and 3 of the process are used to identify cooperative module pairs. In step 1, a WPI network is constructed. Nodes of the WPI network represent genes and links represent direct physical interactions between gene products. The weight of each node represents the degree of necessity of that gene in the cell cycle. In step 2, the consistency score (CT_score) of each gene pair is calculated. Gene pairs with CT_score above the 99 th  percentile are selected as seeds. In step 3, each seed is extended to a module pair. The spanning algorithm is used to search a pair of sub-networks in the WPI network that contain the seed and maximize the module' cooperation score (MCoop_score). The step 6, 7, and 8 of the process are used to identify correlated genes of each cooperative module pair. In step 7, for each identified module pair and each gene  G  in the WPI network, the significance of the number of physical interactions between  G  and genes contained in the module pair in the WPI network is evaluated by random network (see Additional file  1  for more details). For each identified module pair, genes that are significant associated with both modules are selected in step 8.</CAPTION>

Specifically, the data set is first randomly divided into two thirds of samples for training and the remainder for validation. Next, three sets of genes are generated solely based on the training set, and are subsequently used to develop Nearest-Centroid classifiers. Lastly, the classifiers are used to predict the validation samples and their respective prediction performance measured by accuracy (Acc), specificity (Spec), sensitivity (Sens), and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) are calculated. The process is repeated 50 times and the averaged performance metrics are reported in Table 2.</CAPTION>

The flowchart depicts that input can either be variation or sequence data. In case sequence data is provided, it is converted to variation data. Although the variation data is generated by comparison with rCRS, the most common normal base is used to compare the frequency of the variation in patients and normal individuals. The variation is scanned for reported or predicted functional impact only if its frequency is higher in patients or the variation is absent in the normal individuals. Each variation is tested for its reported or predicted functional impact based on its genomic context (in protein coding genes/tRNA/rRNA, etc). A Weighted Score is assigned to each variation based on the information obtained from literature and the  in silico  prediction tools (scores shown in pink boxes). As seen in the inset, the scoring scheme is conceptually driven following the Central Dogma and the scores range from 1 to 10, where a more deleterious variation gets a higher score. The parameters and scores are implemented in a flexible manner to ensure their easy modification and updation with the advent of new information.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Flow diagram . The DISCLOSE application uses functional categories to evaluate the cluster results given a dataset (A), clustering algorithms (B), and clustering parameters (C). Clustering can be performed by the DISCLOSE application or based on results from external clustering programs (D). Each clustering run is evaluated (E) for overrepresented functional categories by the program using different annotation sources (F), and optionally by a motif identification algorithm (G). Lastly, results of the clustering analysis are cumulated in a tabular display in which each row shows the summary of the application of a clustering method to the data (H). From the tabular display, selecting results for an individual clustering (I) allows for a cluster based analysis (see Fig. 2A).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Working scheme of Pre-S Gene Chip analysis . The virus DNA is extracted from the patient's blood or liver tissue. The pre-S region is PCR-amplified using PCR-1R and 5'-dig-labeled 1F primers. The PCR products are visualized using agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. In cases where no PCR products are seen---perhaps because of a low HBV DNA titer---nested PCR using PCR-2R and 5'-dig-labeled 1F primers is done. When only a single PCR product is seen, the DNA product is directly subjected to chip hybridization. However, when two or more different types of pre-S PCR products are seen in agarose gel, the products are first directed to TA cloning. Multiple plasmid clones are then analyzed using colony PCR with M13R and 5'-dig-labeled 13F primers. These PCR products are then analyzed using the Pre-S Gene Chip.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>HECTAR: A method to predict subcellular targeting in heterokonts</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Hierarchical architecture of HECTAR . Five categories of subcellar targeting can be predicted by the HECTAR method: signal peptides, type II signal anchors, chloroplast transit peptides, mitochondrion transit peptides and proteins with no detectable N-terminal target peptide. Each decision module (yellow boxes) runs several selected methods (white boxes) to detect specific target peptides. Selected outputs from these methods are then submitted to a SVM which combines these predictors to determine whether a particular target peptide is present in the sequence being analysed. Protein sequences are first analysed by the "signal peptide/anchor" module where a multi-class SVM determines whether a signal peptide or a type II signal anchor is present. If a signal peptide is detected, this sequence is removed from the N-terminal end of the protein sequence and the modified sequence is analysed by the "chloroplast targeted" module which determines whether the signal peptide is followed by a chloroplast transit peptide. In this module the result of a search for the ASAFAP motif is included in the decision process. If a chloroplast transit peptide is present the protein is classified as chloroplastic, otherwise it is classified as having either a signal peptide or a type II signal anchor. When the "signal peptide/anchor" module did not predict either a signal peptide or a type II signal anchor, the protein sequence is analysed by the "mitochondrion targeted" module to determine whether a potential mitochondrion target peptide is present. If a mitochondrion target peptide is found, the protein is assigned as being targeted to the mitochondrion, otherwise it is classified as having no N-terminal target peptide.</CAPTION>

(For simplicity this flowchart assumes that ISZM is also the number of aggregates. In reality ISZM is frequently larger than the number of aggregates.) ICLU - code number of a peak. ILAB - label of an aggregate. IP - counter of peaks belonging to the same aggregate. CP - characteristic position of a peak. IIPOINT1(ICLU) - characteristic position of the ICLU-th peak. IIPOINT2(ICLU) - label of the aggregate at the ICLU-th peak. IIPOINT3(ICLU) = T - the type of the ICLU-th peak:  T  = 1 - single peak,  T  = 0- merged small peak,  T  = -1 - merged major peak. The values of the IIPOINT2 and IIPOINT3 vector elements are updated at each level. IILEVEL1(ICLU) - level at the top of the ICLU-th peak. IILEVEL2(ICLU) - level of the saddle where the single ICLU-th peak coalesces with another peak. IHELP(ILAB) - number of characteristic peak positions falling into an aggregate labeled by ILAB. IHELP(ILAB,IP) - the code number of the peak belonging to the IP-th characteristic peak position in the aggregate labeled by ILAB. IFINAL(ICLU) = 0 - when ICLU-th peak is eliminated from the analysis. IFINAL(ICLU) = 1 - when the aggregate belonging to the ICLU-th peak is copied into NSTRF. ISZVEC(IP) = -1 - the IP-th peak has merged with other peak at a higher level. ISZVEC(IP) = 0- the IP-th peak was a small single peak at the previous level. ISZVEC(IP) = 1 - the IP-th peak was a major single peak at the previous level. INEW - number of single peaks merging with each other at the current level. IHIGH - number of major peaks from the INEW single peaks. Other notations are at the legends to Figure 6.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>The p53HMM algorithm: using profile hidden markov models to detect p53-responsive genes</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Original Data from El-Deiry et al., Used To Define The p53 Consensus Binding Site . The original DNA fragments collected from a genome-wide, p53-antibody immunoprecipitation, that were used to define the head-to-head (HH) p53 Consensus Binding Site, are graphically presented [ 3 ]. The yellow columns corresponding to the 1 st  and 2 nd  half-sites were used to define the consensus p53 motif. The p53 binding site is highly degenerative. Within the yellow columns, notice that 7 of the 20 DNA target sites (35%) had at least one nucleotide insertion (green), deletion (red), or both (magenta) relative to the discovered 10 bp-spacer-10 bp consensus. Since insertions and deletions throw off the reading frame of a weight matrix, any PSSM approach will inherently mis-score at least 35% of these 20 sites. Alignments of the 160 experimentally validated p53 binding sites also reveal that any PSSM approach would inherently mis-score at least 30% of them as well. Another observation is that additional p53 half-sites are immediately adjacent (in yellow) to the ones used to define the consensus in 15 of the 20 target sites (75%). Since the genome-wide immunoprecipitation study was designed to pull down the highest affinity sites, the fact that 75% of the target sites are actually p53 cluster-sites is the first indication that cluster-sites of 3 or more half-sites confer higher binding affinity [ 22 ].</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Automated layout of multistem junctions . Raw R2R output is shown for the  manA  motif [ 19 ], a pseudoknot (lower right) and a "skeleton"-style drawing (upper right). The layout of the central multistem junction was determined using R2R's solver functions. This motif presents an atypical case where it is not possible to direct all stems horizontally or vertically. The directions of the stems were chosen manually to promote symmetry, the lowest two stems on the junction were constrained to be aligned vertically, and the midpoint of these two stems was aligned horizontally with the upper-most stem. Subject to these constraints, R2R's solver chose a layout that best approximated a circle. The layout was used in a previously published figure [ 19 ]. A finished drawing would require assembling the pseudoknot (as in Figure 1), and moving text. Modular structures present in some  manA  RNAs are not shown. Note: the text "0-6 nt" was moved inward manually to fit the column width.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Ultra-Structure database design methodology for managing systems biology data and analyses</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Basic existential ruleform . Ruleforms are tabular data structures that define the structure of rules. All columns of a ruleform can be divided into factors and considerations, which roughly correspond to the antecedent and consequent, respectively, of an "if/then"-style construction. Factors are the means by which rules are addressed and selected, and in practice are implemented as keys in a database system. The remainder of the columns are known as "considerations", and provide metadata about a rule, as well as additional information that may influence the ultimate processing of a rule. The ruleform shown here is a simplified version of the BioEntity ruleform, which is used to define the existence of concepts and entities that participate in various biological processes. It is also an example of an existential ruleform, which is used to declare the existence of entities in the system.</CAPTION>

Typical of such outer membrane fractures, a profusion of spicules lie about the perimeter or lie flat along the outer membrane surface. Consideration of the fracture process explains the disposition of these spicules. If the spicules are tightly rooted to their bases, and the bond energy of their composition exceeds that of the interaction between their surfaces and the ambient ice, then the spicules would be pulled out of the frozen material that is cleaved away by the knife fracture, and would then fall onto the newly exposed surface thereby demonstrating their original continuity with it. Differences in angles of cleavage may explain the relative sparseness of the spicules on the top of the exposed surface compared to the edges. Scale bar, 100 nm.</CAPTION>
