The output lists the protein domains included in the insert and some gene specific information (more can be found in a separate list). The alignments are displayed in an image below: The target sequence is covered by three forward and one reverse sequences. Three further sequences could not be aligned to the target. The target gene is shown on top of this image as a grey bar with its coding sequence in blue. Below, the different sequences are plotted in different shades of grey with green parts representing the vector sequence. The sequence at the bottom is drawn in red to indicate that its orientation is reversed, i.e. that it was detected by sequencing from the 3' end and therefore determines the 3' end of the insert. The part of the gene that is actually covered by the sequences is emphasised with a box around it. Regions of the target gene not covered by sequences are marked with a thin red line on top of its bar and listed in the text. Protein domains are shown as horizontal purple bars reflecting their position in the cDNA. Below the figure, links to the raw data (sequences and BLAST results) are included.</CAPTION>

Once a library is selected, library-specific parameters related to PET extraction will show up, such as spacer sequences and minimum/maximum PET length previously entered during library creation. Once the extraction parameters are confirmed or modified by the users, the DNA sequence file in FASTA format is browsed and uploaded. The 'sequencing center' accommodates different naming conventions for sequence IDs (used in input files) generated by different sequencing centers. The selection of a given naming convention method from the 'sequencing center' is needed for the system to properly parse individual sequences in groups of specific wells and plates for particular libraries. The user also needs to specify if the library is a GIS-PET or ChIP-PET library.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>IGF-I activates caspases 3/7, 8 and 9 but does not induce cell death in colorectal cancer cells</TITLE>
<CAPTION>IGF-I -induced caspases activation is neutralised by anti-IGF-IR antibody   IGF-I-induced activation of caspases 3/7 (a, b), 8 (c, d) and 9 (e, f) in HT-29 cells and caspase 3/7 in SW620 cells (g, h) is neutralised by anti-IGF type 1 receptor antibody (IGF-IR ab). Cells were pre-incubated with (+) or without (-) IGF-IR ab (400 ng/ml) for 30 minutes and then treated with (+) or without (-) IGF-I (50 ng/ml) for 48 hours. The cellular caspase 3/7, 8 and 9 activities were analysed with Caspase-Glo assay kit (Promega, Madison USA). To check whether any IGF-IR antibody neutralization of IGF-I action is a specific effect a general mouse IgG was included (i, j). For mouse IgG control experiment cells were pre-incubated with (+) or without (-) mouse IgG (400 ng/ml) for 30 minutes. The caspase 3/7 activity was analysed with the same method as IGF-IR ab. Significance value: * P< 0.05; ** P< 0.01. SCM-serum containing media; SFM-serum free media.</CAPTION>

Panel A shows the immunodetection of ABCG5 (tracks 1 – 6), ABCG8 (tracks 7 – 12) in membrane preparations from human liver (HL, tracks 1, 2, 7, 8) mouse liver (ML, tracks 3, 4, 9, 10) or rat liver (RL, tracks 5, 6, 11, 12). The anti-ABCG5 peptide antibody detected a faint mouse band, but no other specific binding was identified. Although the pre-immune sera detected bands in the rodent tissue samples, none were detected in human liver (tracks 13 – 16, MB, mouse brain). Specificity was further shown by pre-incubation of the antibodies with the peptides they were raised against (panel B). In the presence of the specific peptides, the 75 kDa bands are not detected in human liver microsomes. Panel C shows the results of deglycosylation of human total liver microsomes, probed with anti-ABCG5 (left hand panel), anti-ABCG8 (middle panel) or anti-transferrin (right hand panel). Aliquots from the same incubation were separated for all three western blots. Although ABCG5 and ABCG8 do not appear to have their SDS-PAGE mobility's altered by either EndoH or PNGase F treatment, that of transferrin in the same samples is clearly effected (see Text for discussion). Newly synthesized (sensitivity to EndoH), as well as mature forms of transferrin (resistant to EndoH, but fully sensitive to PNGase F) are present in the liver membrane preparations.</CAPTION>

Flies were fed with liquid diets provided by capillaries under the same conditions as feeding assays. A. Selected survivorship curves. Data were compared using the log rank test. (1) p<  0.0001 as compared to the water only condition, meaning that exogenous sucrose favored hypoxic survival. P<  0.0001 as compared to 10S10Y and 10S-10Y conditions, meaning that exposing flies to yeast decreased hypoxic survival. (2) p<  0.0001 as compared to water only, meaning that these flies did not die of starvation and that a yeast exposure was toxic to the flies. P = 0.0001 as compared to the 10S10Y condition, meaning that ingestion of sucrose limited yeast toxicity. (3) p = 0.0001 as compared to the 10S10Y condition, meaning that self selection conditions (and a reduced yeast intake) improved hypoxic survival. B, C. Survival after 72 hours of chronic hypoxia. The horizontal line and the grey bars indicate the survival of starving flies maintained on a source of water. Means  ±  sem are indicated. B. (1) p<  0.01 as compared to water only, p<  0.01 as compared to the 5S-5Y and 5S5Y conditions. (2) p<  0.01 as compared to all other conditions. (3) not different from the 5S-5Y condition. C.

<CAPTION>Schematic diagram of the exon/intron structures of the regions encoding the catalytic domain of pART family members.  A) Exon/intron structures were determined by BLASTn searches of the human genome sequence with individual pART cDNA sequences. Only the exons corresponding to the catalytic domain of PARP-1 are shown. The coding region is marked in red, the 3' untranslated region (utr) is marked in white, and a blue bar marks the region corresponding to the catalytic domain. Exons are represented as boxes with the width of each box reflecting the size of the respective exon (the 3' utr is not drawn to scale). Exon numbers are given with exon 1 corresponding to the exon encoding the presumptive initiation methionine. In all cases except pART4 (VPARP) the catalytic domain is encoded by the 3' terminal exons. Exon sizes (or size of coding region in case of the 3' exons) in basepairs are indicated on top of the boxes. Introns are depicted as triangles and are not drawn to scale. Intron sizes in base pairs are indicated on top of the triangles. The position of each intron with respect to the reading frame is indicated in the triangles (0 = between codons, +1 = between codon positions 1 and 2, +2 = between codon positions 2 and 3). Conserved exon boundaries are marked by colored arrows. Codons corresponding to the H-Y-E motif in the NAD binding crevice of DT and PARP-1 (see Fig. 1) are marked by yellow circles. B) The catalytic domain as delineated in this paper is indicated by the dashed rectangle. For each pART the cDNA coding region within the catalytic domain is marked by a straight line, regions extending beyond this domain in the 5' direction (and in the 3' driection in case of pART4) are marked by dashed lines. The positions of the codons corresponding to the H, Y, E residues in the NAD-binding crevice are indicated by vertical lines. Intron phases are indicated by circles (phase 0), boxes (phase 1), and triangles (phase 2). Numbers indicate the distance in codons between the conserved histidine in  β  1 and the next upstream phase 0 intron. Color-coding of conserved introns corresponds to that shown in A).

<CAPTION>Methods for quantitative assessment of function, infarction and perfusion .  (A)  A long axis magnetic resonance image (MRI) was used to plan short axis images of the left ventricle (LV) (parallel white lines). Slices 3-6 were used for analysis. Endocardial and epicardial borders of the LV were manually delineated on short axis cine MR images in end diastole (ED) and end systole (ES). Wall thickness was quantified in a 12-segment model. Delayed enhancement images (Contrast) were obtained at the same slice positions. Transmurality of infarction was quantified using manual delineation of the borders of the LV endocardium, epicardium and infarction, employing the same 12-segment model.  (B)  Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were reconstructed in the same fashion as for MRI. Regional perfusion at rest and stress were assessed quantitatively using the same 12-segment model. See text for details.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Both the  α  and the  β  isoforms of HSP90 are secreted by MDAMB453 cells and interact with MMP2 and MMP9 metalloproteinases . (A) Cell lysates were immunoblotted with mAb 4C5 recognizing both isoforms of HSP90 and serving as positive control. Concentrated supernatants derived from the cell cultures as described in Methods, were analyzed by Western blot using anti HSP90  α  and anti HSP90  β  antibodies and mAb 4C5. Anti beta actin antibody was used in both fractions. Secretion of the two isoforms of HSP90 was detected in the supernatant derived from MDAMB453 cells. The absence of beta actin in the supernatant demonstrates that there is no contamination of this fraction with the intracellular components of cells during the experimental procedure. (B) Western blot analysis of concentrated supernatants derived from MDAMB453 cell cultures, using anti-MMP2 and anti-MMP9 antibodies showed that both the pro-MMP2 and pro-MMP9 as well as their activated forms are present in the culture medium. Proteins derived from the culture supernatant were immunoprecipitated with anti-MMP2 and anti-MMP9 and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot with anti-HSP90 α  and anti-HSP90 β  antibodies. Both isoforms of HSP90 interact with the two metalloproteinases. Irrelevant IgGs and anti-MMP2 or anti-MMP9 antibodies were used as negative and positive controls respectively. (C) Proteins derived from the MDAMB453 cell culture supernatant were immunoprecipitated with anti-HSP90 α  and anti-HSP90 β  antibodies and immunoprecipitants were analyzed by Western blot using the anti-MMP2 and anti-MMP9 antibodies.

<TITLE>A multi-treatment experimental system to examine photosynthetic differentiation in the maize leaf</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Mechanisms of differential regulation . The C 4 -specific regulation of four hypothetical genes and their protein products is illustrated. During the establishment of the C 4  syndrome, novel regulatory mechanisms that were absent in the C 3  state control the accumulation of proteins A and B. In the case of A, a protein that accumulates in all photosynthetic cell types in the C 3  state is restricted to a specific cell type, by a  trans  acting factor X, without any change to biochemical function. Gene B, expressed at low levels, accumulates in a specific cell type. Proteins C and D also accumulate differentially in the C 4  state, but, in these instances, differential accumulation is the result of a novel cellular environment. In the case of C, protein accumulation is regulated post-translationally at the level of assembly or stability through interaction with A. In the C 4  state and the absence of A, product C fails to accumulate. Such a scenario does not require differential accumulation of C transcripts, but could affect transcription of other genes. Transcription of gene D is linked, either directly of indirectly, to the presence of a metabolic signal Y. The accumulation of Y is governed by the activities of proteins A and B. In the C 4  state, changes in the accumulation of A and B affect the levels of Y and subsequently alter the accumulation of D. Boxes represent genes and spheres represent gene products.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Promiscuity maps . A. SSRIs interact with multiple classes of ion channels, and increases neurosteroid synthesis (by directly modulating a rate limiting enzyme activity), in addition to its activity on the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT). Neurosteroids are themselves promiscuous modulators of ion channels, and some of these interactions are shown (dotted lines from purple box). The impact of increasing serotonin is manifest at potentially any of seven categories of serotonin receptor (each with several subtypes), spanning ionotropic, metabotropic, varying localization, and different second messenger cascades. B. Promiscuity map of direct interactions of SSRIs with various metabotropic receptors and transporters (polygons), as well as ion channels (rectangles) including K channels (blue), Ca channels (green), LGICs (yellow). Distance from the central SSRI node approximates the log-scaled affinity of SSRI for the various targets. Concentric dotted circles reflect 3 orders of concentration magnitude (0.1, 1, and 10  μ M).

<CAPTION>Effects of probe number on the inferences of differential gene expression . The median number of gained (black) and lost (red) inferences of differential gene expression (Y-axes) in simulated data sets subjected to random probe masking relative to actual data are plotted against the number of probes in a probe set (X-axes) (see text for details). Error bars represent the observed range of inferred differential gene expression in the simulated data sets. Red and black data points are slightly off-set for visual clarity. Data from probe sets with even (Panels A, C, E, G, and I) and odd numbers of remaining probes (Panels B, D, F, H, and J) are presented separately, as described in Figure 3. The tissue from which the data was collected is indicated in the lower left hand corner of each panel. Note the different scales on the y-axes for heart and testes.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Systematic interpretation of microarray data using experiment annotations</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Systematic interpretation . For systematic interpretation of large datasets, the comprised variance can be divisively split up in a "top-down" "by-trait" assessment shown in panel a: After regarding the variance between a small number of trait clusters (Figs.  2  and  3 ), the variance within each cluster is analyzed separately in the same way (Figs. 6 and 7 in the  Additional file 1 ) until analyses consist of single traits. Thus, the top-down approach proceeds from the predominant variance to more subtle changes, answering the question which traits are different and which similar transcriptionally. In contrast, an agglomerative "bottom-up" approach will focus on few traits initially (panel b). These may stem from a single annotation (aspect, parameter) of special interest (e. g. alcohol consumption, Fig.  4 ). In further steps, the most interesting annotation (not necessarily representing large variance) is combined with other aspects to visualize their interaction.</CAPTION>

Cells were exposed to the same total surface area concentration of particles (3.5  ×  10 7  μ m 2  per well) and the number of intracellular particles was counted by LSM. From the number of intracellular particles, the total particle surface area taken up by the cells was calculated. At the same surface area concentration, the number of 0.05  μ m particles exceeded the number of 1  μ m particles taken up by the cells (A), however, the fine particles accounted for a greater intracellular particle surface area (B). Due to the small sample size (n = 3) and the use of the Mann Whitney u-test, these obvious differences failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.1).

<CAPTION>Co-immunoprecipitation of a) p68 and b) p72 with HDAC1. a) HDAC1 was immunoprecipitated from U2OS nuclear extracts using an HDAC1-specific antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and the presence of HDAC1 and associated p68 was detected by western blotting with p68- and HDAC1-specific antibodies. b) HDAC1 was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts of 293 cells expressing myc-tagged p72 using an HDAC1-specific antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and the presence of HDAC1 and associated myc-tagged p72 was detected by western blotting with HDAC1- and myc epitope- specific antibodies. In both experiments a control immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed using an irrelevant rabbit IgG. An aliquot of nuclear extract (NE) was also included in the western blots (west.) as an additional control. H denotes cross reaction with the antibody heavy chain.

<TITLE>Critical evaluation of methods used to determine amplification efficiency refutes the exponential character of real-time PCR</TITLE>
<CAPTION>The dynamics of amplification efficiency under a sigmoidal paradigm . (A) A Log(F C ) vs. cycle number plot of the predicted sigmoidal F C  dataset taken from the 1,880 molecule profile presented in Figure 4. This reveals a log-linear region that is nearly identical to that produced by the actual F C  dataset (Figure 6). The numerical inlay summarizes the results of the linear regression analysis. Numbers above and below the plot are the respective F C  and E C  values predicted for each cycle. (B) Plotting -Log of the loss in cycle efficiency vs. cycle number produces a linear region, illustrating an exponential loss in amplification efficiency within the log-linear region. (C) Plotting the loss in amplification efficiency against reaction fluorescence expressed as a percentage of F max  generates a line, reflective of the linear relationship between amplification efficiency and amplicon quantity. This provides a simple method for estimating the loss in amplification efficiency based on expressing reaction fluorescence as a percentage of F max . Close correlation between the predicted (red circles) and actual (dots) values is maintained down to the point at which read precision is compromised by low reaction fluorescence, as reflected by the two lowest actual E C  values. The numerical inlay summarizes the results of the linear regression analysis based on the actual E C , excluding the two lowest values.</CAPTION>

Since codon repeats were very frequent in  C. albicans  and also in the other species we have computed separated the proportion of codons that appeared isolated or in identical codon-pairs, -triplets or longer strings.  C. albicans  had lower frequency of isolated codons (non-repeated identical codons) than the other species, although there was general repression of isolated codons in all species (panel A). This bias was reversed for repetitions of 2 or more identical codons, which again was exacerbated in  C. albicans  (red bar; panels B-D).</CAPTION>

This mutant does not bind estradiol but still binds the synthetic ligand hydroxytamoxifene. The ER sequence has been cloned at the 3' end of the MCS and the reading frame is thus open from and throughout the MCS to the stop codon ending the ER sequence. In contrast, in pPRIGp VP16HA and pPRIGp KRABHA, the sequence coding the functional module (VP16 transactivating domain from human herpes virus or KRAB transrepressing domain from human KOX1 protein) was cloned upstream of the MCS. The reading frame is thus open from the start codon of the module to the stop codon of the in-frame HA sequence 3' of the MCS. Pa: site for PacI. The two PacI sites of pPRIGp VP16HA and pPRIGp KRABHA are symbolized by vertical bars. For each vector, the unique sites of the MCS are indicated above the MCS.</CAPTION>

We set the Hill parameter  n  to 2 in order to represent dimer binding of transription factors as proposed in the study by Roeder et al [ 23 ]. The self-activation threshold  k s  was set to 0.01, resembling a highly sensitive self-activation in comparison to the mutual inhibition.  B  Simulation of the ODE system from [ 23 ] with a high  unspecific transription rate . We show an exact reproduction of the phase plane displayed in Figure 2(h) from the original publication. Both dynamical systems are similar in terms of multistability, steady state positions and attractor basins, i.e. the initial values that fall into a certain steady state.</CAPTION>

(c) Topological similarity for LC interaction graph:  The empirical data have similar similarity values as those found for the  network shuffle  graphs, whilst the similarity is significantly higher for each of these than is found in graphs sampled from the  random graph  ensemble. For each plot, the results are shown for the simple topological ensembles and also those graph ensembles which are constrained using biological traits.

<CAPTION>Each Synaptic Pathology Alters the Trade-Off between Completion and Separation . The average performance of the 100 best parameter combinations illustrated in Figure 5, were used to represent optimal autoassociative performance. To simulate pathological changes in each synaptic property, parameter values were increased or decreased by various degrees in each of the 100 optimal networks, and the error rates in pattern completion and separation were re-assessed. A) Changes in the strength of LTP were implemented by increases or decreases in g max AMPA, relative to optimal values (opt, y axis). B) Changes in the strength of LTD were implemented by multiplying optimal  γ LTD  values by different amounts. C) Connectivity levels were increased or decreased relative to the optimal level (50%). D) Changes in relative inhibition were implemented by multiplying optimal values by different amounts. Each simulated pathology shifted the trade-off between completion and separation, with opposite effects when the synaptic properties were increased or decreased.</CAPTION>

The P100 fraction (from 50 OD 600  cells) from panel A, was loaded on an OptiPrep gradient. After centrifugation, the fractions were tested by immuno-blot analysis using anti-HA, anti-Ypt31 and anti-EMP47 antibodies. Trs130-HA fractionates with two other membrane proteins, Ypt31 and EMP47. C. Trs130 can be extracted from the P100 fraction by salt, but not by detergent. Resuspended P100 fractions (100  μ g) were incubated with 0.5 M NaCl or 1% Triton X-100, and subjected to centrifugation. 50  μ g were examined by immuno-blot analysis as described in panel A. Emp47 serves as a control for a trans-membrane protein that can be extracted by detergent, but not by salt. Bands were quantified and percent distribution in S100 and P100 is shown.

<CAPTION>Domain search and domain prediction using ProFAT .  (A)  Results for Dip13 α /APPL1 [GenBank: NP_036228 ] from a ProFAT domain search. RPS-BLAST identified a PH-domain and a PTB-domain in the input query, the N-terminal region does not contain any conserved domains with the chosen E-value cutoff (E< = 1E-04). The upper window gives the user a description of the domain as found in CDD by mousing over the domain box. The image represents the sequence with identified conserved domains. The table at the bottom lists the identified domains with their amino acid boundaries in the input sequence. By either activating the checkboxes or by clicking on the region and/or conserved domain on the image, the user can select conserved domains/regions for further processing by the  Annotation Engine  and/or  Threading Engine  (selectable by a check-box and activated by pressing the 'Submit' box). In this case, the N-terminal region from amino acid 1 to 280 was selected for further processing.  (B)  If no domain was identified, the user can perform  Domain Prediction . In this case, a RPS-BLAST search with an E-value cutoff of 100 is used to identify weak domain hits. The consensus sequences of these domains are, in turn, submitted to a regular BLAST-search with subsequent text-mining for keywords occurring in the user-provided keyword list. In the case of the Dip13 α /APPL1 N-terminal domain, RPS-BLAST finds SMC-domains, Biopterin_H, as well as a COG-domain. The identified domains can be submitted to the  Annotation Engine  and  Threading Engine  for a more detailed analysis (link 'Send to ProFAT').</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Detection of circulating B cells capable of producing ANCA in response to CpG-B . PBMCs from 2 MPO +  ANCA vasculitis patients were cultured with CpG-B and IL-2. These PBMCs had not undergone enrichment for B cells prior to culture. After 5 days culture, cells were transferred into ELISpot wells which had been coated with either myeloperoxidase (MPO) in duplicates or foetal calf serum (FCS) as a control antigen. After overnight culture, IgG antibody producing cells against these antigens were detected by anti-human IgG conjugate. The total number of IgG producing B cells was measured by coating the wells with polyclonal anti-human IgG. The results from a patient as shown in this figure are representative of results from 2 patients. Fig  A  shows ELIspot plate with total IgG producing cells in the first column followed by the detection of anti-MPO B cells in duplicates in the middle columns and finally cells against the control antigen. The numbers of spots counted are depicted in Figure  B . In spite of both patient and control having similar number of IgG producing cells, the number of anti-MPO B cells is higher in the MPO +  patient. This result coincide with those from a parallel experiment where PBMCs from this pair of individuals were cultured in the presence of CpG-B to measure their  in vitro  production of anti-MPO by ELISA as shown in ( C ).</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Common themes and cell type specific variations of higher order chromatin arrangements in the mouse</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Three-dimensional relative radial nuclear distribution of mouse chromosome territories from a total of 481 nuclei with two labeled pairs of chromosomes each. Each nucleus was divided in 25 shells with equal spacing. The relative amount of the signal from a given chromosome paint probe or of the DNA counterstain (cst) in each of the shells was measured and averaged over all nuclei of the respective cell type (see Methods for details). Graphs on the left (a,d,g,j,m) show the percentage of each signal in the 25 shells. Error bars in (a-o) show the standard error of the mean. For each nucleus and territory signal, the median radius of the relative radial distribution was calculated (see  additional data file 1  for complete listing). Graphs in the center (b,e,h,k,n) show the averages of these medians plotted against the gene density of the painted chromosome. In the graphs on the right (c,f,i,l,o) these averages of medians are plotted against chromosomal size. For cell types with investigated territories from six types of chromosomes, the black lines show the linear regression. The box shows the correlation coefficient R and the p-value indicating the probability that there is no correlation but that the observed relation was a chance result. Both values were calculated from individual medians from all nuclei while the regression line shown was fitted to the six average values of the medians represented by the dots. (a-c) Lymphocyte nuclei in S-phase (continuous lines in (a), circles in (b), all six investigated chromosomes) and in G0 (broken lines in (a), squares in b,c, MMU11 and MMUX only). In (b,c), data points for average medians in G0 lymphocytes fall exactly on data points in S-phase and are thus difficult to distinguish. G0 lymphocytes were not included in the linear regression analysis. (d-f) Fibroblast S-phase nuclei. (g-i) ES-cell S-phase nuclei. (j-l) Macrophage G0 nuclei. Color code shown in (a) also applies to (b-l). (m-o) Myoblast (continuous lines) and myotube nuclei (broken lines). Correlation coefficients for myoblasts (0.26, p = 0.032) and myotubes (0.68, p<  0.001) are not directly comparable since only two chromosomes were investigated. Note that in all cell types there is a correlation for gene poor as well as large chromosome territories to be more peripheral, although for some chromosome territories average medians diverge from this pattern.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Equilibrium abundance of the common pathogen type relative to the subordinate variant . The  y  axis shows the dominance ratio,  D : the abundance of the common type divided by the abundance of the rare type. In general, the skew in abundances remains moderate until the parameters move near the boundary conditions for invasion shown in Figure 1. Near the boundary, the abundance of the rare type drops sharply, causing a steep rise in relative dominance by the common type. The  x  axis shows the cost,  δ / β , for the rare type. The three curves in each panel show, from left to right, the values for  R 0  = 2, 4, 8, which implies that  β   =  k (1 +  α ) for  k  = 2, 4, 8.

The difference in score was calculated by subtracting the left eye (OS) score from the right eye (OD) score for each mouse. The expected result for symmetric degeneration would be a score of '0' for each animal, but clearly there is dramatic scatter of both the optic nerve and retina scores. Optic nerves also show a trend for asymmetry at an early age, consistent with the hypothesis that early damage occurs first in the nerve. Retina asymmetry is more pronounced at ages when the mice show clear signs of retinal degeneration.</CAPTION>

A In the mutant where transcription factor A is deleted (disrupted) the expression of gene B is significantly different from its expression in the wild type. The transcription factor A does not bind to the putative promoter region of gene B (no green arc), but to the putative promoter region of transcription factor C, which in turn is found in the putative promoter region of gene B. This indirect path from A to B in the ChIP network might therefore explain the direct path in the mutant network.

Three main clusters are found in each species, with one cluster containing mainly alcohols (cluster ant #1, bee #1 and rat #2), and another containing the three aldehydes (cluster ant #2, bee #3, rat #1). B) Inter-odour Euclidian distances in ants as a function of the same measure in honeybees, with either maximized number of odour pairs (Left, 55 odour pairs, 3-5 ants, r = 0.43, Mantel test, p = 0.036) or maximized number of ants (Right, 15 odour pairs, 5 ants, r = 0.76, Mantel test, p = 0.018). C) Inter-odour distances in ants as a function of the same measure in rats (36 odour pairs, 3-5 ants, r = 0.75, Mantel test, p<  0.001). D) Running correlation between instantaneous Euclidian distances in ants (maximizing ant number, as in B, right panel) and fixed-point distances in honeybees [ 48 ]. The quality of the correlation (r 2  in red) is plotted along with the inter-odour distance (in blue, taken from Figure 2B) showing the separation power of the ant olfactory system throughout a recording. Maximum correlation is obtained very shortly after odour application (~200 ms), and remains high throughout odour presentation. After odour offset, correlation decreases but oscillations are observed, with high correlation epochs as late as 5 sec after odour application, when activity and the separation powerof the ant system are low. Orange bars below the graph indicate significance in running Mantel tests 1) between ant data at each 200 ms time bin and the fixed-point bee data or 2) between ant data at each 200 ms bin and fixed-point ant data 200 ms after odour onset (frame termed 'ref' in the figure). Significant correlation rebounds (see text) are marked with orange arrows. Circles correspond to plots between ant and bee data on the upper right, showing instantaneous Euclidian distances in the ant as a function of distances in the bee.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>IDSS: deformation invariant signatures for molecular shape comparison</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Our inner distance (ID) signature is compared, for instance, to Euclidean distance (ED) signature from  [ 7 ]. The first row shows the input four artificial proteins with the same main chain orientation but with different molecular shapes. The second row shows the ID and ED signatures. In each plot, the vertical axis represents distance distribution. Note that ID is not sensitive to shape deformation, so four signatures are almost consistent; in contrast, ED is strongly sensitive to deformation.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Differential Muc2 and Muc5ac secretion by stimulated guinea pig tracheal epithelial cells  in vitro</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Muc2, but not Muc5ac, secretion increases with pro-inflammatory stimulation in GPTE cells.  a)  Total protein concentration of pooled samples of mucin collected from the apical surface or as intracellular lysates of non-stimulated GPTE cell cultures was determined using the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein were used to coat ELISA wells (76 ng/well), and then the presence of Muc2 or Muc5ac was examined. Results indicate that, in unstimulated GPTE cells, there is a higher ratio of intracellular to secreted Muc2 when compared to the ratio of intracellular to secreted Muc5ac. Samples from six cultures were pooled. Error bars represent assay variance of triplicate measurements.  b)  GPTE cells were exposed to air for 7 days during which time goblet cell differentiation occurred and mucus secretion began. Apical surfaces were washed, media changed, and then collected for secreted mucus baseline after 12 hrs incubation at 37 ° C, 5% CO 2 . Media was then changed and cultures were rested for 8 hrs and exposed to cytomix for 4 additional hrs. Relative amounts of Muc2 or Muc5ac in experimental and baseline collections were determined by ELISA. Experimental absorbance values were then corrected with baseline values, allowing each well to serve as its own control. These normalized values are expressed as a percentage of CONSTITUTIVE secretion observed during the 12-hr rest/exposure period, with the amount of Muc2 or Muc5ac secreted in cultures exposed only to media arbitrarily set at 100% of constitutive secretion. Results indicate Muc2 secretion is augmented by cytomix exposure, while Muc5ac secretion is equivalent in cytomix-treated and media-exposed (control) cultures. n = 5 in each group. ** = Significant change from constitutive mucin secretion by Student's  t -test (p<  0.05).  c)  GPTE cells were exposed to cytomix or media (as a control) for 4 hrs. Then cells were lysed and assayed for intracellular mucin. The amount of Muc2 or Muc5ac in intracellular lysates from cells exposed only to media was arbitrarily set at 100%. In intracellular lysates from cells exposed to cytomix, both Muc2 and Muc5ac production was increased 50% over CONSTITUTIVE mucin levels. Subsequent time points (8 or 12 hrs exposure) showed a return to constitutive intracellular levels (data not shown). n = 6 in each group. * = Significant change from constitutive mucin production by Student's  t -test (p<  0.01).  d)  GPTE cultures were exposed to 4, 8, and 12 hrs of cytomix. Total RNA was collected and Muc2 and Muc5ac transcript levels were determined using real-time RT-PCR. At 4 hrs, Muc2 mRNA levels were significantly increased when compared to constitutive expression. A trend toward an increase in both Muc2 and Muc5ac mRNA levels following cytomix exposure when compared to constitutive expression was observed at later time points. n = 4 – 6 in each group. * = Significant change from constitutive mucin production by Student's  t -test (p<  0.05). All data points are presented as mean  ±  SEM.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Expression of  SPLUNC1  in TBE cells grown at the ALI is not induced by pro-inflammatory mediators but requires continued RA driven differentiation .  A . TBE cells isolated from three different donors were grown at the ALI as described in the materials and methods section. Cells were treated for increasing lengths of time with 25 ng/ml of IL-1 β  prior to isolation of RNA. Expression of  SPLUNC1  was investigated by the use of RT-PCR with exon spanning primer pairs as described in the materials and methods section. Primers to Elafin and WFDC2 were used as controls.  B . The effect of withdrawal of RA from the ALI growth medium was tested in TBE cells from the same three donors. ALI cells were established using standard grow conditions in medium containing 50 nM all trans retinoic acid (RA). After 14 days in culture RA was removed from the medium of one group of cells and culture was continued for an additional 18 days. RNA was harvested at 7 and 14 days during ALI growth and 20, 26 and 32 days following RA removal for 6, 12 and 18 days respectively prior to the isolation of RNA. Expression of  SPLUNC1  was investigated by the use of RT-PCR with exon spanning primer pairs as described in the materials and methods section with primers to GAPDH serving as a positive control.</CAPTION>

The two left columns show the effect of spatial attention on the visual ERP in the "attend visual" group. A clear contralaterally distributed P1 component was seen at occipital electrodes, followed by an anterior N1 attention effect (seen at the F3/4 sites; upper left group of maps) and a somewhat later posterior N1 attention effect (seen at Cp1/2, upper right group of maps). Subsequent to the modulation of the P1, a second more ipsilateral positivity was present in the occipital channel with a peak latency of 250 ms. The right two columns depict the crossmodal effects of spatial auditory attention on visual ERPs in the "attend auditory" group. Here, no clear P1 modulation was present. Instead, only the second positivity at 260 ms was present in the occipital channels (see lower right group of maps). The frontal N1 effect seen in the visual group was greatly attenuated. Instead, visual standards at the attended location showed a positive displacement from 200 ms onwards at frontocentral sites. The posterior N1 clearly showed a modulation as a function of auditory spatial attention (see lower left group of maps).

<CAPTION>Distribution of interacting proteins with respect to the (a) structure-based functional similarity, (b) annotation-based functional similarity and (c) functional consistency . The interaction data from the MIPS, DIP and BioGRID databases were used. The functional categories and annotations were obtained from FunCat in MIPS. (a) The functional similarity of each interacting protein pair was measured by the maximum structure-based similarity of the pair-wise functions they have in a hierarchy. More than 60% of interacting pairs have the functional similarity less than 0.4. (b) The functional similarity of each interacting protein pair was also measured by the maximum annotation-based similarity of the pair-wise functions they have. Around 60% of interacting pairs have the functional similarity less than 0.2. (c) The functional consistency of each interacting protein pair was finally measured by the proportion of the common functions they share. As similar to the distribution in (b), more than 60% of interacting pairs have the functional consistency less than 0.2.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Raw and normalised melt curves . A) Typical examples of raw fluorescence melt curves. Six replicates of an oligonucleotide representing a fragment of the unmethylated CDKN2A promoter were amplified using the CDKN2A primers and QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit, then melted by increasing the temperature from 60 to 90 ° C, rising in 0.5 ° C increments, waiting for 30 s at the first step and for 5 s at each step thereafter, acquiring fluorescence at each increment. Raw fluorescence was plotted against temperature. The plots show that the magnitude of the starting fluorescence may vary significantly even between replicates. B) Graph of raw fluorescence plotted against temperature from one sample from Figure 1A shows that there are three distinguishable phases. In Phase 1 there is a linear decrease in fluorescence with increasing temperature (represented as a solid blue line). In Phase 2 there is a rapid reduction in fluorescence which is a combination of the linear decrease and the melting of dsDNA. During Phase 2 the observed fluorescence ( F(T)obs ) is less than the fluorescence expected from the Phase 1 alone ( F(T)max ). The reduction in fluorescence due to the melting of the dsDNA alone at any given temperature (vertical dotted red line) is the difference between  F(T)max  and  F(T)obs ,  F(T)melt  (solid red line with arrow heads). In Phase 3 the dsDNA is fully melted and there is no further decline in fluorescence. C) Normalised melt curves for the six replicates in Figure 1A. The normalised fluorescence was calculated by the formula  F(T)obs / F(T)max  at every given temperature increment. Normalised fluorescence expressed as a percentage was then plotted against temperature.</CAPTION>

The region indicated by two half arrows was used for promoter activity assays presented in (B). It was amplified and cloned to yield an 840 bp test fragment  (B)  This putative bi-directional promoter fragment was used in a luciferase reporter gene assay to measure transcriptional activity. Basal promoter activity was found for both transcriptional orientations compared to a promoterless control (pGL3) vector. The 5'-3' orientation of the fragment ( 1110005A03Rik  orientation,  Rik ) yielded only half of the transcriptional activity as it was measured for the 3'-5' orientation ( Jmjd6  orientation,  Jmjd6 ). The values reported for the transfection experiments are means  ±  standard deviation of three independent triplicate experiments.

Labrid  vtgs  are shown on dashed lines since no genomic data are currently available for linkage maps. The ZfVTG1-8 cluster is preliminary oriented according to increasing bp loci and a BLAST hit for the Ssx2ip protein.

<CAPTION>Structural constraints on GFP polypeptide insertion .  A)  GFP trap hotspots: the left chart plots the relative frequency of GFP insertions in introns between exon-exon boundaries comprising predicted structural domains, regions of intrinsic disorder or unclassified regions. The right chart plots un-trapped introns from the same genes and shows a reduction in the intrinsically disordered category.  B)  Consequences of GFP insertions: in cases where GFP insertions fall into predicted structural domains, mapping of domain sequence to known structures of proteins of the same fold shows that it is mostly surface exposed areas that are affected. In both examples, the overall fold of the GFP target domain is unlikely to be affected by the insertion. Note that the linker residues and the C-terminus of GFP (blue dotted lines) are predicted to be highly flexible. The displayed examples show only one possibility for how the GFP domain is structured relative to the host protein.</CAPTION>

(b, c)two copies of a portion of the graph in (a), where complexes (nodes) are linked to one another whenever they share at least 2 components, and the node size is proportional to the number of unique proteins each complex contains. (b)and (c)have the AP and MCL clusters respectively mapped onto the curated complexes, so that pie charts show proportions of complex components that are annotated to the same AP or MCL cluster. The mapped clusters are computed from versions of the original unweighted network shown in (a) in which 20% of the edges were randomly added and 20% randomly removed. Complexes whose components distribute among many clusters appear as multi-colored pie graphs, whereas those that are annotated to the same cluster appear solid-colored. The bright red color indicates the proportion of components that were assigned to singleton clusters by the AP or MCL algorithm. All the comparisons were performed with partitions obtained by optimizing the MCL and AP parameters respectively (see Methods).

For each state, the total DNA copy-number and the allelic copy-numbers are given. State 0 is the germline state also called the normal state; state 1 corresponds to a heterozygous deletion (loss of one allele); state 2 corresponds to a homozygous deletion (loss of two alleles); state 3 corresponds to uniparental di/polysomy (loss of one allele and duplication or multiplication of the other allele); state 4 corresponds to unbalanced amplification (duplication or multiplication of only one allele); state 5 corresponds to balanced amplification (duplication or multiplication of both alleles). Notice that when the SNP marker in the germline DNA is homozygous, states 3, 4 and 5 are very similar and states 0 and 3 cannot be differentiated in case of uniparental disomy.  B .

<TITLE>Correction of scaling mismatches in oligonucleotide microarray data</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Effect of different transcript concentrations illustrated by MvA plots . A) An MvA plots of mis-scaled data (top) and normal data (bottom). In the top plot, the combined effect of non-linear signal response and differences in transcript concentration causes the points to lie in curved region (replicate 2 is the darker microarray, both replicates taken 8 hours after irradiation). In contrast, when transcript concentrations are similar the cloud of points is not curved, but aligned with the horizontal axis (bottom plot, replicates 1 and 2 for the 0 hours time point). Focusing back to the top plot (region boxed in red), one can see how scaling mismatches occur in the median signal range: since the scaling performed in MAS5 takes into account almost all the signals, the signals of those genes lying in the median signal range are underscaled on the second chip: the median section of the cloud is underneath the horizontal axis. B) The scaling mismatch is even more striking when considering a simple time course application using the raw data. Within each replicate, intermediate time points have been linearly interpolated using neighbouring time points (e.g. for the 2 hours time point, the 0 and 4 hours chips have been used). The relative difference between those interpolation results and the actual values have been computed and the graphs show, for each intermediate time point, the first, second, and third quartile of the distribution of these relative differences. The scaling imbalance that occur with non-rescaled data is particularly visible for the 8 hours time point on the second replicate. To see how our algorithm corrects this problem, see Figure 6.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Schematics of the ci-ELISA and protein microarray procedures . 5  μ g of the artificial antigens (CL or SM 2 ) are coated onto the 96-well plates in (A) ci-ELISA, or 20 ng of the artificial antigens were spotted onto the protein microarray slides in (B) protein microarray. Antibodies against the particular artificial antigens are added together with a range of concentration of the corresponding hapten. As the haptens would compete with the immobilized artificial antigens for binding to the antisera, an increasing concentration of the hapten would result in a decreasing signal. For ci-ELISA, the bound antibodies are visualized by an anti-rabbit-HRP conjugated antibody with the addition of a chromogen (A). For the protein array, the secondary antibodies are conjugated to a fluorescent dye (Cy3), and the signal can be directly measured by a fluorescence microarray scanner (B).</CAPTION>

Note that most orthologous groups exhibit low Ratio1 and Ratio2 values, in all three data sets. For example, in panels A and D, about 86% of orthologs have Ratio1 and Ratio2 values less than 1. However, the higher quality data set (panels B and E) contains fewer points at higher Ratio values versus the RBH-predicted data set. The lower quality data set contains more points with very high Ratio2 values (i.e. only 73% of points have Ratio1 and Ratio2 values less than 1), potentially reflecting the increased occurrence of probable cattle paralogs (i.e. paralogs being misidentified as orthologs by an RBH-analysis with an incomplete cattle genome).</CAPTION>

A total of 5 transfections were performed and data were statistically analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. Compared with LacZ shRNA, RGM249 and mt-1RGM249 shRNA significantly suppressed hTERT mRNA (P = 0.002 and P = 0.034, respectively). mt-1RGM249 and mt-2RGM249 correspond to those in Table 2.  ▯  RGM249 mRNA,   hTERT mRNA,   RPL22 mRNA, *: P<  0.05; **: P<  0.01. Quantitative evaluation of the suppressive effect of shRNA in which the measurement, in the case without siRNA, was regarded as 100% for standardization (N = 5).

Although the results depended on the timing of cell harvests after transfection, telomerase activity in transfectants with RGM249 shRNA was reduced to approximately half compared with that in parental cells, and we observed a periodicity of 6 bp due to reduced telomerase in the shRNA lane. NC: telomerase negative control.</CAPTION>

There is a critical vaccine efficacy (77% in this example), such that no amount of vaccination can eradicate targeted types of the disease if the efficacy falls below this critical value. In this case, eradication of targeted types could only occur if more than 100% of children were vaccinated, which is not possible. B. If the vaccine efficacy allows for eradication of targeted types, there is a critical vaccine immunogenicity (80% in this example), such that even 100% of childhood vaccination will not eradicate targeted types of the disease. In this case, there is a minimum level of adult vaccination coverage that is required for eradication of targeted types (18% if the immunogenicity falls to 75%), even if 100% childhood coverage levels can be achieved. Adult immunogenicity was assumed to be equal to childhood immunogenicity. All other parameters as in the Table.</CAPTION>

In each row, the left column has a guest tree leaf name and the right column has the associated host tree leaf name.  (d, e, f)  The reconciliation  γ   can be input to primetv in three different formats:  (d)  The  full  reconciliation,  γ , in tabular format. For a host tree node  x  (the left column),  γ ( x ) (the right column of the same row) comprise all guest tree vertices whose incoming edges appear on the incoming edge of  x  in the reconciled tree, cf.  γ (4) as indicated in Figure 3(a). Notice that a guest vertex can map to several host vertices.  (e)  The  reduced  reconciliation,  , in tabular format. This is achieved from a full reconciliation,  γ , by, for each host tree vertex  x , removing from  γ ( x ) all guest vertices that are ancestral to other vertices in  γ ( x ), e.g., 8 in  γ (4).  (f)  The reconciled tree ( G ,  γ ) in  PrIME  format. This is a Newick tree with  PrIME  tags added to tree vertices; a sequence of  PrIME  tags are always given within brackets and are preceded by the tag specifier&& PRIME. For a guest vertex,  v , the tag ID indicates a unique number identifying  v . If no ID-tag is given, e.g., in Newick format, identity numbers are assigned automatically. The tag AC indicates the ID-numbers of the host tree vertices that  v  maps to in the reduced reconciliation  ; these host tree vertices should always form a path in the host tree. Additionally, for a leaf  l , the tag S indicate the label of the host tree leaf that  l  maps to. When reading host trees primetv will assume that numbers after colons (:) represent (ultrametric) edge times rather than edge lengths. This can be made explicit by using the tag ET in the  PrIME  format.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Known isoforms of CPEB3 proteins . Gray boxes represented possible functional motifs. Dash-lined boxed represented deletions. For simplicity, the names of the motifs were only labeled in isoform 1. Poly-Q (poly-glutamine) and SA (poly serine-alanine) were two unique motifs of CPEB3 that were absent in the other three CPEBs. In the current study, each of the seven isoforms was named corresponding to the same numbered cDNA transcripts depicted in figure 1. Protein isoform 1 was the longest (716 aa) and may be derived from cDNA transcripts 1a-1d. One possible polymorphorism was located at the 372 th  amino acid of CPEB3 isoform 1: it was an N (asparagine) in [UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:  Q7TN99 - Q7TN101 ] and [GenBank:  AAQ20843 ] but a P (proline) in [GenBank:  NP_938042 ,  BAE27791 ,  BAC41458 ]. Although the sequence of [GenBank:  BAC41458 ] was reported as 722 aa, we presume it was 716 aa, since the first 6 amino acids QQAAQT preceding the 7 th  amino acid M (methionine) was likely to be falsely generated by the prediction software. Isoform 7 was derived from computational translation based on the novel transcript 7 identified in the current study. The upstream sequence of this isoform was yet to be determined; but the in-frame translation of the identified sequence would result in truncated RRM1 ending with four unique amino acids (LNWQ) and removal of RRM2. 197 P  represented the 197 th  serine, a phosphorylation site [ 31 ]. The positions of the gray-box and dash-lined-box motifs were indicated at the top and the bottom, respectively.

Following integration of the vector, cells were selected by puromycin and each puromycin-resistant colony was picked and replated to 96-well cell culture plates individually. The master plates were stored frozen and the duplicate tester plates were generated. Both tester plates were subjected to the infection by another replication-defected retrovirus expressing Cre-recombinase. One of the tester plates was cultured in normoxia and the other tester plate was cultured in hypoxia. Following incubation in each environment for 18 hrs, cells were fixed and stained with 9E10 antibody and staining patterns were analyzed using Axiovert 200 M microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a motorized automated stage and fluorescence filters using Open Lab Image analysis software (Improvision).

<CAPTION>Transduction of primary rat skeletal myoblasts by the retroviral vector MLV-CX43-EGFP and resultant overexpression of connexin 43 . Connexin 43 and EGFP were expressed from a single bicistronic transcription unit.  (A)  Transduction of primary rat skeletal myoblasts using various dilutions of the MLV-CX43-EGFP viral vector preparation. Medium in the wells of a 24-well plate containing non-confluent primary myoblasts was aspirated and the wells were filled with 1 ml of the non-diluted and diluted viral vector suspensions supplemented with Polybrene ™  (10  μ g/ml). After 48 hours the cells were trypsinised, washed in complete DMEM medium, resuspended in PBS and used for FACS analysis to determine the efficiency of transfection relying on EGFP expression. The obtained data were averaged among 3 wells for each virus vector dilution.  (B)  Concomitant use of RetroNectin ® -mediated viral vector concentration and polycation transduction enhancement for delivery of the connexin 43 and EGFP genes into primary skeletal myoblasts using MLV-CX43-EGFP vector. Transduction experiments were performed in 6-well plates containing non-confluent myoblasts in the presence of the polycation Polybrene ™  (10  μ g/ml), in the presence of the polycation Transfectam ®   (5  μ g/ml) or without addition of polycations. The efficiency of transduction was determined using the EGFP marker from the FACS subtraction plots using non-transduced primary skeletal myoblasts as a control, non-fluorescent cell population. The data were averaged among 6 individual transduction experiments.  (C)  Fractions of EGFP-positive cells in the population of connexin 43/EGFP transduced primary skeletal myoblasts during continuous passaging. The cells were split and re-seeded in the ratio 1:10 each week with concomitant FACS measurement of the fraction of the EGFP-expressing cells.  (D)  Results of FACS analysis of populations of primary skeletal myoblasts plotted as histograms (x-axis  –  intensity of green fluorescence, y-axis  –  counts of cells). Purple graph corresponds to non-transduced primary skeletal myoblasts, red graph corresponds to the primary skeletal myoblasts after RetroNectin ® -mediated Transfectam ® -enhanced transduction by MLV-CX43-EGFP, green graph represents primary skeletal myoblasts, which were preparatively sorted for EGFP expression after transduction by MLV-CX43-EGFP.  (E)  Western blotting analysis of connexin 43 expression in connexin 43 transduced skeletal myoblasts (after EGFP-based preparative sorting). The cell extracts were analysed by electrophoresis in a SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotting using anti-connexin 43 antibody. Lane 1 corresponds to non-transduced primary skeletal myoblasts, lane 2 corresponds to connexin 43 transduced primary skeletal myoblasts, lane 3 corresponds to connexin 43 transduced primary skeletal myoblasts, which were passaged 13 weeks in tissue culture.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>The cumate gene-switch: a system for regulated expression in mammalian cells</TITLE>
<CAPTION>A. Screening of 293-CR5-LacZ clones . G418-resistant clones were infected with AdCMV-cTA in the presence and absence of 200  μ g/ml cumate. Forty-eight hours later,  β -Gal activity was measured. The figure shows the subclone # 13 displays high-level expression and the best ON/OFF ratio, almost 40-fold.  B. Screening adenoviral library of cTA mutants.  293CR5-LacZ cells were infected with the adenoviral library of CymR mutants and overlayed with agarose supplemented with Blue-gal. Plaques formed by the infection of adenovirus expressing the wild-type cTA are  β -gal positive in the absence of cumate, and  β -gal negative in the presence of 200  μ g/ml cumate.  C.  The plaque indicated by an arrow is a candidate for the reverse phenotype, since high  β -gal expression is evident in the presence of 200  μ g/ml cumate.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Quantitation of Siglec-F ligands in airway epithelial cells and peribronchial inflammatory cells in WT and Siglec-F deficient mice challenged with IL-4, IL-13 or TNF- α . WT or Siglec-F deficient mice were administered either IL-4, IL-13, TNF- α , or PBS diluent control. Twenty four hours after each individual cytokine or diluent challenge, the mice were sacrificed. BAL was obtained for determination of eosinophil and neutrophil cell counts, and the lungs were processed for immunohistology to detect Siglec-F ligand expression and MBP+ peribronchial eosinophils using a light microscope objective at 20 × . Administration of either IL-4 (p<  0.001, WT; p<  0.001, Siglec-F deficient) or IL-13 (p<  0.001, WT; p<  0.001, Siglec-F deficient) induced a similar significant increase in levels of Siglec-F ligand expression by peribronchial cells (Fig 7A-C, 7E). In contrast, administration of TNF- α  induced a small increase in peribronchial Siglec-F ligands (p<  0.01)(Fig 7E), but did not significantly increase Siglec-F ligand expression by airway epithelium in either WT or Siglec-F deficient mice (p = ns) (Fig 7 D, 7F). Administration of either IL-4 (p<  0.001 WT; p<  0.001 Siglec-F deficient) or IL-13 (p<  0.001 WT; p<  0.001 Siglec-F deficient) induced significantly increased levels of Siglec-F ligand expression by airway epithelium (Fig 7A-C, 7F). Although both IL-4 and IL-13 induced strong upregulation of Siglec-F ligand expression by airway epithelium (Fig 7F), levels of Siglec-F ligands in airway epithelium were slightly lower in Siglec-F deficient vs WT mice induced by IL-13 (p = 0.02) but not IL-4 (p = 0.10) (Fig 7F). IL-4 induced the strongest eosinophil response in BAL (WT p<  0.03; Siglec-F deficient p = 0.02)(Fig 7G) and lung (WT p<  0.001; Siglec-F deficient p<  0.001)(Fig 7H), while IL-13 and TNF- α  induced a weaker eosinophil response in BAL (Fig 7G) and lung (Fig 7H). TNF- α , but not IL-4 or IL-13, induced a strong neutrophil response in BAL in both WT (p = 0.03) and Siglec-F deficient mice (p = 0.03) (Fig 7I)(n = 3 mice/group).</CAPTION>

<TITLE>ST3Gal.I sialyltransferase relevance in bladder cancer tissues and cell lines</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Bladder cancer cell lines express both T and sialyl-T antigens . The bladder cancer cell lines, 5637, HT1376, MCR and T24, treated with heat-inactivated neuraminidase ( A ) or with active neuraminidase ( B ) were analyzed by Flow cytometry using fluorescent PNA lectin. The gray line shows the controls without PNA. The T antigen is expressed at high levels by the HT1376 and MCR cell lines, but only weakly by 5637 cells and at an intermediate level by T24. According to the results obtained after removing the cell surface sialic acid by neuraminidase treatment, the 5637 and T24 cell lines express the T antigen masked by sialic acid.</CAPTION>

Activity change rate or normalised activity change ratio were plotted against pre-experiment visual analogue scale score (pre-experiment VAS) (A, C) or change rate of visual analogue scale score after the experiment ( Δ VAS) (B, D). Activity change rate was calculated as change of activity of the visual cortices during the visual search from pre-fatigue to post-fatigue sessions divided by the session time (hour) of the fatigue-inducing period. Normalised activity was calculated as activity of the auditory cortices in a given section divided by that in the first section. Normalised activity change ratio was calculated from the slope of regression fitted to a scatter plot of the time course (section) against normalised activity. Subjects were asked to rate subjective sensation of fatigue on the VAS from 0 to 10. Squared Pearson correlation (R 2 ) and P value are displayed.

<CAPTION>Oct4-binding to  Xist  intron 1 decreases faster when differentiated in the presence of RA . Quantitative ChIP analyses of Oct4-binding to  Xist  intron 1 show faster reductions in Oct4-binding kinetics when wild-type and  Tsix -deficient male cells were differentiated by EB+RA versus EB methods. Note that, for each experiment, we started with a single d0 (undifferentiated) culture for both X/Y and X Δ /Y, and then split them on subsequent days for analysis. Thus, d0 samples were the same for all EB series and for all EB+RA series, and their values were duplicated in the graphs for easier comparisons with d2, d4, d6 samples in the same series. Means  ±  s.e.m from two independent biological replicates are shown. Pairwise comparisons were made between corresponding samples (EB vs. EB+RA) normalized to the control IgG ChIP (background) for each time point.

Note that for most of the measures and programs used, there is a systematic trend in the difference between MPS and MR imaging over the range of values when MR imaging is on the horizontal axis, but this is not apparent when MPS is on the horizontal axis. This implies that there are systematic differences between MR imaging and MPS, and these can not be adjusted for when one only has LV volume values from MPS</CAPTION>

Difference image obtained at 30 minutes post-Gd-probe contrast subtracted from the pre-contrast image. This image demonstrates an early enhancement by the contrast agent into the urinary bladder extravascular space, which may be attributed to vascular leakage.  C . Difference image obtained at 80 minutes post-contrast subtracted from 30 minutes post-contrast. This image demonstrates a delayed enhancement due to drainage and pooling of the contrast agent, which may reflect uptake within the lymphatics in the bladder.  D . Difference image obtained between images in  B  and  C  (80 min. post-contrast minus 30 min post-contrast, and the 30 min. post-contrast minus the pre-contrast images). This image suggests that there is decreased drainage within tumorigenic areas, and perhaps a pronounced increase in uptake in the lymphatics within normal regions.</CAPTION>

(A) Relationship of transmembrane domain and hydrophobic GPI signal peptide-encoding exon sequences of human and canine CEA family members. The nucleotide sequences of the transmembrane domain exons and exons encoding the GPI signal peptides of human CEA family members were aligned and the results displayed as rooted dendrogram. Three groups can be discriminated: the transmembrane domain sequences of the orthologous genes (CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20) form pairs, CEACAM3, CEACAM4 and CEACAM21 sequences are clustered together with the dog CEACAM1-related sequences (red box) and the GPI signal sequences are most closely related to the CEACAM1 transmembrane exon sequence (blue box). All transmembrane domain exons boxed red are followed by exons encoding cytoplasmic domains with an ITAM except for CEACAM21 and CEACAM29. Their cytoplasmic domains terminate prematurely due to a stop codon at the end of cytoplasmic domain exon 2 and loss of the splice donor site in cytoplasmic domain exon 3 with subsequent read-through into the following intron, respectively.

<CAPTION>Application of CAPPIA for the detection of hormone-dependent interactions . Triplicate slides each carrying 208 features, including all possible combinations of the 16 prey and 10 bait proteins listed in Additional file  1  and sets of positive (p53+SV40T) and negative (p53+TRAF, single baits and preys) controls were reverse transfected with Hek293T cells in the presence of 10 nM R1881 for 3 days. Each prey-bait combination was printed together with the autofluorescent reporter as single spots per slide with a spot to spot distance of 1.5 mm. Following transfection the fluorescence signals of all 624 features were collected and processed as described in methods. The normalised fluorescence signals obtained from the 480 different bait-prey features (10 baits  ×  16 preys  ×  3 replicate slides) are shown separately for the different slides. Sample numbers correspond to the combination of bait and prey as summarized in Additional file  1 . The cutoff value (indicated as red line) resembles the level of reporter expression obtained with the non-interacting control proteins p53+TRAF. This cross-screening using CAPPIA immediately identifies so-called bait-or prey-unspecific false positives as is exemplified by bait B504 (marked with a star). A specific interaction was identified between B487 and P506 corresponding to the AR-LBD and AR-NTD (sample number 23, marked with an arrow).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Comparison of the germline-specific/enriched genes identified by SAGE with the germline-enriched genes identified by the microarray .  (A)  Overview of the comparison between SAGE and microarray. Germline-specific/enriched SAGE data were generated by selecting genes that are identified only by the germline library (germline-specific) and genes that have a 2-fold enrichment of the tag counts in the germline library over the soma library (germline-enriched). Genes were further selected to have a germline tag count  ≥  9. Data correspond to 330 germline-specific genes and 733 germline-enriched genes. Microarray data used were the adult data, with  wt/glp-4  F.I.  ≥  2 (99% confidence> 0).  (B)  SAGE data for the germline-enriched genes identified only by microarray. 'Ambiguous genes' are genes that were not identified as germline-specific due to having an ambiguous tag in the soma (Short-SAGE) library, or that have an ambiguous Long-SAGE tag (Germline SAGE library). 'No SAGE tags' do not have an assigned Long and/or Short-SAGE tag. 'SAGE tags available but not identified' are genes that do have an associated Long-SAGE tag and Short-SAGE tag, and the tags are not ambiguous, but no tags were identified in either library. 'Germline tag<  9' are genes identified in the germline SAGE library, and either were not identified in the soma SAGE library or have a tag count ratio  ≥  2, but have a germline tag count<  9. '1  ≤  germline/soma<  2' refers to genes that were identified in both the germline and the soma SAGE libraries and have a germline/soma tag ratio  ≥  1 and<  2. The expanded category are genes that are only identified in the soma SAGE library, or genes that are identified in both the germline and the soma SAGE libraries with a soma/germline tag ratio>  1.  (C)  The corresponding microarray data for the germline-specific/enriched genes identified only by the SAGE. 'Microarray F.I.' refers to the adult/ glp-4  fold induction value. 'Below confidence level' refers to genes with a 99% confidence level<  0.

The black bars indicate the percentage of explained variance when excluding the variance present in the replicates, and which, therefore, cannot be explained by the regression model. Above the histogram are the mean and variance of the average expression level (AE), the F-statistic (FS) and the number of selected cultivation parameters (NCP) for the groups of genes with explained variance (including replicate variance) as stated on the x-axis of the histogram.  b:  Histogram plot indicating the number of single and combinatorial effects as well as the total number of effects that were selected to explain the observed gene expression patterns.  c:  Histogram plot indicating the number of genes influenced by particular cultivation parameters, either as a single effect, AND effect, OR effect or independent of the effect type ('all effects'). The 'all effects' bar is not the sum of the other three, because genes can be affected by a cultivation parameter both as a single effect and as a combinatorial effect.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Effect of trabecular bone loss on cortical strain rate during impact in an in vitro model of avian femur</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Schematic description of the internal constraining effect that trabecular bone has on cortical bone, and its contribution to resisting impact loads. If loss of core trabecular bone exceeds a critical mass, lack of energy transfer pathways causes impact stresses and strains to concentrate locally close to the site of impact, and the hammer penetrates the cortex, as shown in the top frame. If less than a critical mass of trabecular bone was lost, and sufficient number of trabecular pathways still exist to transfer strain energy away from the site of impact, the cortex deforms as a whole, as in the bottom frame, and, although it may crack, no catastrophic failure occurs. In this latter case, as more strain energy is transferred to the opposite side of the cortex, a strain gauge fixed to that bone aspect will deform more and faster with respect to the first scenario.</CAPTION>

A = high magnification (400X) section of normal mammary gland, hybridized with mouse S100A7/psoriasin  35 S-labeled antisense cRNA. B = high magnification (400X) adjacent section to A hybridized with mouse S100A7/psoriasin  35 S-labeled sense cRNA. C = low magnification (100X) of section from the matched DMBA mammary tumor from same animal shown in A hybridized with mouse S100A7/psoriasin  35 S-labeled antisense cRNA. D = higher magnification (400X) of C. E = high magnification (400X) of adjacent section from the same mammary tumor shown in D, hybridized with mouse S100A7/psoriasin  35 S-labeled sense cRNA. F = low magnification (100X) of a single tissue section (tissue from a different mouse to that shown in A-E)) hybridized with mouse S100A7/psoriasin  35 S-labeled antisense cRNA, where strong focal expression of mouse S100A7/psoriasin RNA is observed in the mammary gland tumor (black arrow) with little or no expression in the surrounding normal mammary gland tissue. B Localization of mouse S100A7/psoriasin expression to areas of squamous differentiation in DMBA-induced mammary gland tumors Sections from formalin fixed paraffin-embedded DMBA-induced mammary tumor samples matched to the frozen tissue from which RNA was previously isolated for RT-PCR analysis were used for  in situ  hybridization analysis of mouse S100A7/psoriasin expression. A = low magnification (100X) of tumor section hybridized with mouse S100A7/psoriasin  35 S-labeled antisense cRNA. B = higher magnification of A (200X), C = high magnification of B. D = adjacent section to that seen in A, B, C, and at same magnification as B but hybridized with mouse S100A7/psoriasin  35 S-labeled sense cRNA. E and F are haematoxylin and eosin stains of adjacent sections to that shown in A, B, C, and D. E is the same magnification as in B, and F is the same magnification as that shown in C. Squamous differentiation in the haematoxylin and eosin stained adjacent sections is visualized as a characteristic "pearling" pattern where epithelial tumor cells (purple) differentiate into keratinocytes (pink) before denucleating and sloughing off into the inner lumen (white). Thus cells on the outer margin of the pearled area are undergoing squamous differentiation, and those correspond to cells expressing mouse S100A7/psoriasin RNA, in A, B, and C.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Phospholipids are hydrolyzed by phospholipase A 2  liberating arachidonic acid and Lyso-PAF, regulators of insect's immune system . Arachidonic acid is the substrate for eicosanoid production, prostaglandins via cyclooxygenase and leukotrienes via lipoxygenase. Lyso-PAF is acetylated by PAF-acetyl transferase releasing PAF that can be degraded by PAF-acetyl hydrolase that hydrolyses PAF regenerating Lyso-PAF. In the presence of dexamethasone the immune responses are inhibited due to the suppression of phospholipase A 2  activity with lower production of eicosanoids and PAF. On the other hand when exogenous arachidonic acid is added there is enhancement of eicosanoid production and immune responses increase.</CAPTION>

The genes encoding for differentially expressed unknown larval and guanine nucleotide-binding proteins were selected for mRNA analysis by real-time RT-PCR. mRNA levels were characterized in individual whole ticks naturally-infected with different pathogens using sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers. In all cases, matching groups of uninfected tick samples were analyzed concurrently for comparison. The graph depicts the infected to uninfected mRNA ratio (+SD) calculated by dividing normalized mRNA levels in infected ticks by the average of the normalized mRNA level in uninfected control ticks.

<TITLE>Stop! In the name of transforming growth factor- β : keeping estrogen receptor- α -positive mammary epithelial cells from proliferating</TITLE>
<CAPTION>A hypothetical model of paracrine versus autocrine signaling in mammary epithelial cells. Normal mammary epithelial cells expressing estrogen receptor (ER) α  and progesterone receptor (PR) are restrained from proliferating, mediated by the growth-inhibitory actions of transforming growth factor (TGF)- β  signaling, active in this population. The steroid receptor-positive cells secrete local-acting growth factors to induce neighboring cells to divide in a paracrine fashion. In early breast cancer progression, this normal paracrine mechanism may switch to an autocrine loop, allowing steroid receptor-positive cells to proliferate, possibly through the downregulation of active TGF- β  signaling, leading to an upregulation of cell-cycle molecules such as cdc25A, cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)2.

<TITLE>SEQADAPT: an adaptable system for the tracking, storage and analysis of high throughput sequencing experiments</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Integration of analysis tools . An automated system is used to integrate new analysis tools with Addama. The robot system is responsible for delivering the correct inputs to an analysis script, monitoring the process while it runs, and then for publishing the results of the analysis back. Web applications can then be built on top of standard Addama APIs for providing customizable input information for specific scripts, and then for visualizing the results of the analyses. The loose coupling of each of the web applications from the underlying analysis script makes the system robust to change and (relatively) easy to maintain - especially when the scripts are under constant revision.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>HIV-1 TAR element is processed by Dicer to yield a viral micro-RNA involved in chromatin remodeling of the viral LTR</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Model for the generation and action of HIV-1 TAR derived miRNA . Basal transcription of the HIV-1 LTR produces short RNA transcripts containing the TAR element. These RNA elements are directed to the cytoplasm where they are processed by Dicer to yield a viral miRNA. This viral miRNA associates with the RISC or RITS complex and through homology to sequence contained in the viral RNA, as well as the proviral genome, may direct silencing of viral gene expression. Alternatively, the viral miRNA may contain sufficient homology to mediate silencing of cellular genes. Our work identifies a role for Dicer in the generation of an HIV-1 miRNA, but we cannot rule out the involvement of Drosha  in vivo . An alternate pathway for the generation of this miRNA is indicated by the dashed arrows. It should be noted that the two pathways may generate miRNA with slightly different sequence, as cleavage by the Drosha enzyme would eliminate some sequence from the base of the stem.</CAPTION>

Maximum Likelihood inferences were performed with the JTT+ Γ  (4 categories) model by TreeFinder [27] on two datasets based on the Philippe et al. [22]  Metazoa dataset and constructed as follows. The species were grouped according to 12 OTUs. Sequences with at least 90% of the total number of positions were considered as complete and sequences or chimera shorter than 10% of the total number of positions were removed. The two datasets differ on the main criteria of selection, A: longest sequence (LC) and B: smaller evolutionary distances (SC). Numbers above branches indicate bootstrap support values obtained by analysing 100 bootstrap replicates under the same conditions.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Schematic representation of the phylogenetic pipeline used to reconstruct the human phylome. Each protein sequence encoded in the human genome is compared against a database of proteins from 39 fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes (Table 1) to select putative homologous proteins. Groups of homologous sequences are aligned and subsequently trimmed to remove gap-rich regions. The refined alignment is used to build a NJ tree, which is then used as a seed tree to perform a ML likelihood analysis as implemented in PhyML, using four different evolutionary models (five in the case of mitochondrially encoded proteins). The ML tree with the maximum likelihood is further refined with a Bayesian analysis using MrBayes. Finally, different algorithms are used to search for specific topologies in the phylome or to define orthology and paralogy relationships.</CAPTION>

The classical I κ B-NF κ B signaling cascade proceeds through the sequential phosphorylation, ubiquitination (ub) and proteosomal degradation of I κ B α  and the coordinate release and nuclear translocation of NF κ B. Hyper-activation of NF κ B in cancer can be overridden by hyper-activating RAR with retinoids. As such retinoid therapy induces malignant reversion but is associated with retinoid toxicity. Proteosome inhibitors quell RAR trans-activation and enhance RAR trans-repression of NF κ B.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>The immune profiling armamentarium . The number of high-throughput molecular and cellular profiling tools that can be used to profile the human immune system is increasing rapidly. Proteomic assays are used to determine antibody specificity or measure changes in serum levels of cytokines or chemokines using multiplex assays. Cellular profiling assays are used to phenotype immune cells based on intracellular or extracellular markers using polychromatic flow cytometry.  In vitro  cellular assays can measure innate or antigen-specific responsiveness in cells exposed to immunogenic factors. Genomic approaches consist of measuring abundance of cellular RNA and also microRNAs that are present in cells or in the serum. Other genomic approaches consist of determining gene sequence and function (for example, genome-wide association studies, RNA interference screens, exome sequencing).</CAPTION>

The VEGF family consists of seven ligands derived from distinct genes (VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D, and -E, placenta growth factor [PIGF] -1 and -2). VEGF family members have specific binding affinities to VEGF receptor (VEGFR) -1, VEGFR-2 and BEGFR-3 tyrosine kinase receptors as shown. In addition, neuropilin (NRP)-1 and NRP-2 are co-receptors for specific isoforms of VEGF family members and increase binding affinity of these ligands to their respective receptors.

The Resource (A) contains gene-, SNP-, and disease-related primary resources and constructs a primary information database. The Automatic pipeline (B) retrieves information from primary databases and extracts essential gene-, SNP-, and disease-related data. We mapped disease terms and aliases, or gene names and aliases, based on the UMLS and HGNC databases. Also, disease terms were corrected for noun modification, stop word, and suffix. SNP effects were investigated by amino acid substitution; locations are available. The Diseasome (C) is a database including three categories of information (gene, SNP, and disease), and relationships among the three categories.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>Chromatin, gene silencing and HIV latency</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Variation in the level of proviral expression within cell clones might be accounted for by the degree of methylation. In this model the degree of repression, set up at the time of integration, is critical to the degree of gene expression. Studies supporting this model include [36,47,49,50]. DNA methylation is an attractive candidate as a molecular correlate of repression and is depicted as such here and in Figure 2. There is, however, evidence suggesting that other molecular mechanism may be involved (see text).  (a)  Provirus integrated into repressive chromatin is stably repressed, probably correlating with a high degree of proviral DNA methylation.  (b)  Provirus in partially repressed chromatin is unstable and may proceed to become tightly repressed, or continue to be expressed but could be induced to a higher degree of expression. The change in epigenetic mark could arise from cell division.  (c)  Integration into permissive chromatin leads to high-level gene expression.</CAPTION>

However unreplicated segments of DNA in non-centromeric sites and the presence of forks at natural protein-DNA complexes, like the RFB sites on rDNA genes, do not trigger a checkpoint response.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Typical MRI scan changes in GH adenoma . Coronal T1-weighted postcontrast MRI scan at upper left and right, obtained in Patient 3, a 33-year-old man who presented with GH adenomas and acromegaly 7 years before undergoing MASEP GKRS. (Figure 5) An enhancing mass lesion is seen in the sella turcia with extension into the left cavernous sinus. Patient 3's serum growth hormone level was 497.3 ng/ml initially. He was treated with transsphenoidal surgery, and the tumor relapsed shortly with the serum growth hormone level reduced to 130.2 ng/ml. The patient was treated with MASEP GKRS, and MRI was performed for treatment planning. 20 Gy defined to the 50% isodose line is used to cover the full extent of the pituitary tumor in the first radiosurgery, and 28 Gy defined to the 50% isodose line is used to cover the pituitary tumor in the second time one year later.</CAPTION>

In case of low stoichiometry as for the  in vivo  situation enrichment of phosphoproteins is necessary. To cope with this a novel enrichment procedure called metaloxide affinity chromatography (MOAC) is used in the strategy [18]. The whole approach is applicable to identify phosphorylation sites out of complex samples. The library of  in vivo  sites may be used for screening of protein phosphorylation dynamics using triple-quadruple mass spectrometry [6] .</CAPTION>

<TITLE>A computational analysis of protein-protein interaction networks in neurodegenerative diseases</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Retrieval and representation of each disease network.  The differentially expressed genes in MS or AD using blood or brain tissue were obtained from published DNA array studies. The corresponding protein (seed-protein) for each differentially expressed gene was identified in public databases (STRING). The network in which such proteins were embedded was built by retrieving the first neighbor of each protein in the protein-protein interaction database available at the STRING database.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Schematic outline of map-building strategies used in this study . Pilot maps were built for each of the ten populations separately to flip the phase of loci assigned to the wrong phase, to identify multi-locus markers, and to remove loci and lines with excessive numbers of singletons (apparent double crossovers). The quality-filtered datasets were then used to build seven 'component' maps for individual populations with sufficient numbers of lines and loci. The integrated dataset of all ten populations was used to build a consensus map. The quality of the locus order of the consensus map was evaluated by comparison against the order of loci in the component maps and a 'synthetic map' derived from the component maps.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>The main categories of the General Formal Ontology (GFO) as outlined in [14, p. 70]. The basic distinction of GFO relevant for this work relates to items and is between individuals and categories. Individuals are items that cannot be instantiated. Categories are items that can have instances and may be predicated of other entities. The instances of categories of first order are individuals, while higher-order categories have categories as instances. For all items, the  instance-of  relationship is a relation of major importance, linking items (including categories) to the categories of which they are an instance.</CAPTION>

The pattern shown represents the query: “ All the elements of type protein whose name contains the string  “ P53 ”  that are part of an interaction taking place in the nucleoplasm region ” . This pattern was generated while browsing the Homo sapiens Reactome export in Pathway Commons, by declaring as variable two of the elements. It presents several elements describing the structure of a pathway: these are from the BioPAX ontology (blue in the figure). The object of the CELLULAR-LOCATION property is a term defined in Reactome (in purple). Results of this query on the Reactome Homo sapiens ontology are presented in Table  1 . This query can be used both to map its results to an existing Cytoscape network, or to generate a new network from all possible occurrences of the relative pattern in the ontology.</CAPTION>

B) Complementary sequences of CODEHOP PCR primers derived from the "DMGL" motif. The sequence of the complementary strand of the primer is shown to identify the coding sequence. The actual PCR primer is the complement of the sequence. DMGLB was biased towards KSHV-like sequences by using the codons from the KSHV TS gene in the 5' clamp region of the primer with KSHV-specific nucleotides highlighted (3' region of the complementary coding strand shown). DMGLXB was predicted from the amino acid sequence block of the conserved "DMGL" motif using the CODEHOP software and utilizes the most common human codons for the amino acids in the 5' clamp region, and is unbiased in design. The underlined sequence in the 5' clamp region can form a stem-loop structure, shown in C. The CODEHOP PCR primer, DMGLX1B, is a revised version of DMGLXB to eliminate base pairing in the stem-loop structure by changing the highlighted cytosine (C) in Fig. 13-C. to an adenosine (A), boxed in Fig. 13-B.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Schematic representation of the IT4  var  gene repertoire . Gene names, Ups sequence type, domain architecture, chromosomal location, transcription orientation, and binding functions are listed. IT4  var  genes are primarily assigned to different groups on the basis of 5' flanking sequence (Ups type) and chromosomal location when known. PfEMP1 proteins are comprised of multiple domains termed N-termimal segment (NTS), Duffy binding-like (DBL), cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR), C2, transmembrane (TM), and acidic terminal segment (ATS or exon2) which have been classified by sequence criteria into different types. The PfEMP1 proteins in the 3D7 clone were arbitrarily classified into 17 different protein architectural types on the basis of domain composition [6]. Types 18 – 25 (bolded) are unique to IT4. Chromosome locations are indicated as T, ST, SST: first, second, and third  var  genes from the telomere respectively. C: internal  var  genes. t: transcribed towards telomere, c: transcribed towards centromere. The chromosomal location of  var2csa  was determined in [ 78 ]. Accession numbers for newly sequenced genes are  EF158071 - EF158105 .</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Sequences of  P. falciparum csp  haplotypes found among field isolates from two hospitals (PCMH and M-34) in Freetown, Sierra Leone, during September – October 2006 and April – May 2007 . Note that only variable sites immediately after the central repeats (labeled X i.e. amino residues 308  –  317), and the regions spanning the Th2R (amino residues 326  –  342) and Th3R (amino residues 356  –  378) in the C-terminal portion of the gene are shown. Amino residue numbering is with reference to the 7G8 sequence and haplotypes labeled P-01 ~ P-30 are unique to this study. The P-17 haplotype differs from the 3D7 sequence by two silent nucleotide mutations but otherwise has an identical amino acid sequence. As shown, the "Asia-type*" refers to the Th2R*5/Th3R*1 haplotype previously shown to be predominant in Asia, but was not detected in this study.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Carrier frequency comparisons of the different HLA-DRB1 allele groups between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cases and controls across the various Caucasoid and non-Caucasoid population samples and overall effect estimation. This figure provides a summary meta-analysis of allele carrier frequencies according to HLA-DRB1 allele classification, in selected samples among the data available from the 13th International Histocompatibility Working Group on Rheumatoid Arthritis. For each population sample, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) evaluate the significance of the association between the different HLA-DRB1 allele groups and RA susceptibility (blue boxes). The combined ORs and 95% CIs evaluate the significance of the global effect of the different HLA-DRB1 allele groups on RA susceptibility over all population samples.  P  values were calculated with the Mantel-Haenszel method (black diamonds).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>A model for change in cpDNA and nuclear DNA (nDNA) amount during development . The change in parameters affecting cpDNA and nDNA amount between immature and mature tissues is represented. Two cell types are shown, along with the net change expected for a population of both cell types. Arrows indicate an increase or decrease. Dashes indicate no change. In Type 1 cells, cpDNA/plastid and plastids/cell are constant, and the nDNA increase leads to a decrease in cpDNA/nDNA. In Type 2 cells, cpDNA/plastid declines, but both plastid number and nDNA remain constant, leading to a decrease in cpDNA/nDNA. The net change for the population is an increase in nDNA, no change in plastids/cell, and a decrease in both cpDNA/plastid and cpDNA/nDNA.  Shaded boxes  indicate the parameters used to calculate plastomes/cell, based on qPCR and mean ploidy using flow cytometry. Data obtained from these methods represent the net change in nDNA and cpDNA/nDNA for the population and do not assess the cpDNA/plastid. The net increase in nDNA/cell is similar to the net decrease in cpDNA/nDNA because Type 1 cells contribute to the increase in ploidy without contributing greatly to the change in cpDNA/nDNA. As a result, calculation of plastomes/cell yields a similar value for immature and mature tissues, and there appears to be no net change in plastomes/cell (left half of the box in the bottom right corner). If qPCR and flow cytometry could be performed on each cell type separately, calculation of plastomes/cell would reveal no change for Type 1, a decrease for Type 2, and a net decrease for the population (right half of the box), because the contribution of individual cells to the increase in nuclear ploidy and decrease in cpDNA/nDNA could be assessed.</CAPTION>

<TITLE>MUSCLE: a multiple sequence alignment method with reduced time and space complexity</TITLE>
<CAPTION>Additive profiles.  The profile functions in MUSCLE require amino acid frequencies for each column. Here we show the alignment of two profiles X and Y, giving a new profile Z. Note that the count  n Z i  for amino acid  i  in a given column of Z is the sum of the counts in the child profiles, i.e.  n Z i  =  n X i  +  n Y i . In terms of frequencies, this becomes  f  Z i  =  N X f  X i  / N Z  +  N Y f  Y i / N Z , where  N X ,  N Y ,  N Z  are the number of sequences in X, Y and Z respectively. Therefore, given a suitable sequence weighting scheme, it is possible to compute frequencies in Z from the frequencies in X and Y. This avoids the step of building an explicit multiple alignment for Z in order to compute frequencies, as done in CLUSTALW and MAFFT.</CAPTION>

A) Visualization of a graded interaction between the processes of  L  binding and  D  phosphorylation. The same scheme can be taken to demonstrate non-interacting processes. For non-interacting processes the parameter restrictions  k 1  =  k 3 ,  k -1  =  k -3 ,  k 2  =  k 4  and  k -2  =  k -4  hold. B) Visualization of an all-or-none interaction between the processes of binding site phosphorylation and  E  binding.  E  can only bind to phosphorylated sites, while the dephosphorylation of  D  is only possible in the absence of a bound effector. C) The cyclic reaction scheme degenerates to a reaction chain, as the species  D [0, 0,  E ] does not exist. In this case, the notation can be simplified by describing binding site phosphorylation and  E  binding as modifications of the same site.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Effect of cholesterol extraction of calcifying vesicles by ethanol on ultrastructural appearance of vesicles. The transmission electron microscopic image of ethanol treated calcifying vesicles was obtained from a cholesterol-fed rabbit. To reduce the number of cholesterol micelles, calcifying vesicle fractions were centrifuged at 250,000  ×  g for 30 min. To solubilize cholesterol, the resulting pellet was suspended in an aliquot of water and then mixed with alcohol to a final concentration of 60%. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min in a microfuge and the resulting pellet was processed for electron microscopy. The ultrastructural images did not differ from those obtained from untreated vesicles. The alcohol treatment which presumably solubilized free cholesterol did not alter the LDL-C content in vesicle fraction.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Fibrosis in senescent rat choroid plexus.  Aging takes a toll on choroid plexus, functionally and structurally. This electron micrograph depicts massive collagen deposits in CP interstitium, i.e., between the vascular core and outer epithelial (E) ring. Fibrotic (F) bands in a 36-mo-old Brown-Norway/Fischer rat are 40 – 50 times thicker than corresponding collagenous layers in young adults. Excessive fibrosis likely impedes nutrient flow from plasma to ventricles and reabsorption of A β  peptide fragments from CSF. Fibrosis in aging and AD also occurs in the arachnoid [240]. Consequently, fibrosis interferes with CSF dynamics via multiple effects. Appreciation is extended to P. McMillan for electron microscopy. Scale bar = 2  μ m.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Whole-mount transmission electron micrograph of an LSEC treated with 100 nM dihydrohalichondramide for 1 hour, showing the dark nuclear area and surrounding extracted cytoplasm.  Note the presence of small cytoplasmatic areas of intermediated density within the fenestrated cytoplasm. In several of these areas a very peculiar structure could be observed, consisting of rows of fenestrae with increasing diameter, fanning out into the surrounding cytoplasm, connected to the small cytoplasmatic areas with their smallest fenestrae. These structures are suggestive of de novo fenestrae formation and we therefore named them "fenestrae-forming center" (FFC) [ 79 ]. Scale bar, 5  μ m.</CAPTION>

The large number of circular electron-dense bodies are most likely poly-3-hydroxy-butyric acid (PHB) polymers consistent with Nile-Blue staining patterns [4]. The genes encoding PHB biosynthesis proteins have been identified (image by H. Engelhardt).</CAPTION>
