Difference electron density maps were calculated with Fourier coefficients (F o,mutant  - F o,wild-type ) and model phases derived from the wild-type enzyme structure (1OYG, [11]). The maps (2.1  Å  resolution) are contoured at 5 σ  (panels  A - C ) or 4 σ  (panel  D ), with positive and negative density in blue and red, respectively. The stick models are colour-coded by carbon atoms as follows: wild type enzyme (green), D86A (magenta  –  panel  A) , D247A (yellow  –  panel  B) , E342A (grey  –  panel  C ) and raffinose-bound E342A (pale red  –  panel  D ).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Modeling favorable and unfavorable helix flanking conformations . Stereochemical constraints on flanking positions of a model  α L  helix ( φ  = 65 ° ,  ψ  = 42 ° ). (A) Unfavorable flanking conformations. Placing an Ncap residue in the  α -R conformation occludes solvation of the N2 amide by the N' sidechain. A C' residue in the  β R  conformation causes a steric clash between the C' and C3 carbonyls. (B) Favorable flanking conformations. An N' in the  β R  conformation removes any desolvation of the Ncap-N2 amides (shown as spheres). An  α R  C' replaces the carbonyl clash to C3 with a bivalent hydrogen bond from the C' and C" amides. Carbons of residues in the  α L  conformation are colored orange.</CAPTION>

The shades indicate the coronary territories. The middle panel shows the change in geometry during chest trauma. The arrows represent the direction of the large forces induced by the sudden increase in intrathoracic pressure. The circles indicate the areas of high mechanical stress, where rupture is most likely. The right panel shows the endocardial (oblique) muscle fibre orientation, clearly indicating the path connecting the moderated band insertion with the papillary muscle heads where a chest trauma induces increased wall stress.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Sequential binding mechanism in the IL-4/-13 receptor activation . (a) The binding of IL-4 to its cellular receptor follows a two-step sequential binding mechanism. First, IL-4 is recruited to the membrane by its high-affinity subunit IL-4R α ; second, either one of the two low affinity subunits IL-13R α 1 (apparent  K D  ~ 1  μ M) or  γ c  (app.  K D  ~ 1.5  –  2  μ M) is recruited into the complex. (b) For IL-13 the order of the binding events is reversed. IL-13 binds first to the IL-13R α 1 subunit; the affinity of IL-13 to IL-4R α  is below detection limit (app.  K D  >  100  μ M). In the second step the IL-13:IL-13R α 1 complex recruits the IL-4R α  subunit into the complex. Values marked  K D * indicate that these interactions are measured by binding of the soluble ectodomain to the surface immobilized binary complex of ligand and high-affinity receptor subunits. These apparent binding constants do not reflect the real affinity for a two-dimensional interaction in the membrane. (c, d) The location of the binding sites for the receptor subunits IL-4R α  and IL-13R α 1 are conserved between the two cytokines IL-4 (c) and IL-13 (d). Site 1 is used for the interaction with the IL-4R α  subunit, site 2 is used for the interaction with IL-13R α 1 (and for binding to  γ c  in the case of IL-4).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>The preoperative CT scan and 3-D reconstruction . A: CT scan showed that the dorsal strut seemed to lie over the bifurcation of pulmonary trunk (single arrow). Its dorsal tip seemed to have perforated the left upper lobe bronchus (double arrow). B: The ventral strut lay behind the sternum. According to the traditional CT scan images, it was not apparent whether the struts perforated into the right ventricle or RVOT due to metal artifact. C and D: The following 3-D reconstruction of CT scan images revealed intracardiac migration of the two struts. The single arrow marked the dorsal strut, which perforated RVOT. The double arrow marked the ventral strut, which perforated into the right ventricle.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>A-C. Normal pattern of neurogenesis and cell cycle progression in GMR-GAL4. Cells enter S-phase of the SMW after column 0, and most cells (~90%) perform mitosis and degrade their Cyclin B between columns 3 – 5. Arrowhead indicates column 0 in the morphogenetic furrow. D-F. In GMR-GAL4 > RasV12, ectopic neurogenesis occurs after the Second Mitotic Wave is completed (arrow). 100% of SMW cells perform mitosis and degrade Cyclin B in this genotype[11]. G-I. GMR-p21 prevents entry into the SMW, so that no cells contain Cyclin B posterior to the morphogenetic furrow [10] . Ectopic neurogenesis is still delayed until after column 5, however (arrow).</CAPTION>

Coronal mouse brain sections (30  μ m) were prepared from 3xTg-AD mice sacrificed at 2 ( A, I, Q ), 3 ( B, J, R ), 6 ( C, K, S ), 9 ( D, L, T ), 12 ( E, M, U ), 15 ( F, N, V ), 18 ( G, O, W ), and 26 months of age ( H, P, X ) and were processed for immunohistochemistry to detect the human tau P301L mutant transgene product using the HT7 monoclonal antibody ( A – H ), human phospho-tau (Thr231) using the AT180 monoclonal antibody ( I – P ), and paired helical filament pathology using the PHF-1 monoclonal antibody ( Q – X ). Primary motor cortex was examined for patterns of immunopositivity and photomicrographs were obtained at 10 × . The insets in panels  H ,  P , and  X  represent 40 ×  digitally magnified images of designated photomicrographs for better visualization of immunopositive cell/pathology. Scale bar in  D  represents 200  μ m.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Cadherin-11 mediates lining layer-like formation. Discrete regions of tissue culture dishes were coated with fibronectin (FN), followed by blocking of the entire dish with bovine serum albumin (BSA). L-cells were seeded at equal numbers and cultured under serum-free conditions. After 2 days in culture, cadherin-11-expressing L-cells condensed and accumulated at the FN – BSA interphase to form a lining layer-like structure. In contrast, vector control L-cells were randomly distributed at the FN-coated area and did not form a lining layer.

Photomicrographs of wild-type (A, C; 400 × ) and mutant (B, D; 2,000 × ) yolk sac tissues stained for PECAM (red) and E-cadherin (green). Immunofluorescent analysis revealed a decrease in detectable E-cadherin protein in mutant samples. Robust E-cadherin staining is observed in the endodermal (Ed) but not mesodermal (Md) layer of wild-type yolk sac (A). In contrast, very little E-cadherin staining can be detected in yolk sac from  Tie2Cre +/- Srf f / f  embryos (B). Single-plane confocal microscopy (C, D; 4,000 × ) confirms the lack of E-cadherin immunostaining at the apical brush-border surface of mutant yolk sac endodermal cells (compare A and B, arrowheads). Blue stain in A and B is DAPI nuclear stain. Scale bars: A, B = 50  μ m; C, D = 7.5  μ m.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Histomorphometry of microglia response . The picture sequence demonstrates the morphological and spatial changes of microglia in response to experimental bacterial meningitis due to infection with  S .pneumoniae . Microglial staining was performed by staining AIF-1 and sections were observed using a 20  ×  (pictures A, C and E), respectively 40  ×  (pictures B, D and F) magnifying objective. The resting microglia (picture A and B) transforms from a ramified to an amoeboid, phagocytic phenotype during the early acute phase of the disease (pictures C and D). Three days after infection we find a pronounced infiltration of microglial cells into the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (highlighted by dotted lines) where neuronal apoptosis occurs (picture E and F). The transformation and redistribution of the resting microglia to the site of tissue damage is in well agreement with the transcriptional data shown in figure 9.</CAPTION>

Overlay of both stainings (C,F,I). A-C: The top row clearly shows the heterogeneous subcellular distribution from predominant cytoplasmic (lower cell) in the majority of the cell population to mixed cytoplasmic-nuclear in a smaller fraction of cells (upper cell). D-F: In a premitotic cell, survivin localizes to the mitotic spindle apparatus (arrow). Of note, here survivin signal appears stronger compared to the surrounding non-mitotic cells. G-I: In late telophase the mid-body (arrow) stains positive for survivin protein. Original magnifications: 400 ×  (A-I)</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>ATF3 expression in myoepithelial cells of BK5.ATF3 mice . (a). A paraffin section (4  μ m) of a mammary gland from an 8 week old BK5.ATF3 virgin female was stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies to CK5 (Texas Red, red) and CK8 (FITC, green) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. (b-e). Sections were also treated with a primary antibody to ATF3, then stained using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and a chromogenic substrate that produces a brown stain, and counterstained with hematoxylin. Mammary gland from a BK5.ATF3 transgenic female (b,d) was compared with a non-transgenic littermate (c,e). Scale bars = 100  μ m; scale bar in panel c applies to panels b and c, scale bar in panel e applies to panels d and e. (f). Nuclear extracts were analyzed for ATF3 protein expression by immunoblotting as described in Materials and Methods. Equal amounts of protein from mammary glands of non-transgenic mice (lane WT) or BK5. ATF3 mice of line 1 (lane 1), line 2 (lane 2), line 3 (lane 3), or line 4 (lane 4) were analyzed. As a positive control, an extract from RAW 264.7 cells was analyzed (lane C).  β -actin was used as loading control. An ATF3-specific band was detected in the 20 – 25 KD size range in the BK5.ATF3 mammary gland extracts and in the positive control extract; this band was barely detectable in extracts from non-transgenic mice (lane 1). The ATF3 band was abolished by preincubation with the ATF3 blocking peptide (not shown).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Expressions and cell identification of gp91 phox  in peri-contusional area after traumatic brain injury (TBI) . (A) In sham-operated animals, weak immunoreactivity for gp91 phox  was observed in the cortex (upper panel). Two days after TBI, gp91 phox  immunoreactivity was dramatically increased in the peri-contusional area (lower panel). Scale bars = 400  μ m. (B) Co-immunostaining of gp91 phox  with cell markers in the peri-contusional region. Immunostaining was carried out using antibodies for gp91 phox  (shown in green) together with Integrin alpha M (CD11b) (upper), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (middle), and neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) (lower). Microglia, astrocyte, and neuron markers are shown in red. Gp91 phox  immunoreactive cells were co-labeled with all cell markers. Particularly strong expression of gp91 phox  was detected in microglial-like cells (CD11b-positive cells). Cells were counter-stained with DAPI to show nuclei (blue). Scale bars = 20  μ m.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Immunohistochemical localization of Bax in the lung. Lung biopsies were taken 24 h after injection of carrageenan. No positive staining for Bax was observed in the lung tissues collected at 24 hours from sham WT mice ( a ) and from sham TNF- α R1KO mice ( b ). On the contrary, tissue sections obtained from WT animals at 24 hours ( c ) after carrageenan injection demonstrate positive staining for TNF- α  mainly localized in the infiltrated inflammatory cells, pneumocytes as well as in vascular wall. In carrageenan-injected TNF- α R1KO mice, no positive staining for Bax were observed in the lung tissues collected at 24 hours ( d ). Similarly, the treatment of WT mice with Etanercept (5 mg/kg administered s.c. 2 h prior carrageenan) visibly and significantly reduced the positive staining for Bax in the infiltrated inflammatory cells, pneumocytes as well as in vascular wall in the lung tissues collected at 24 hours ( e ). Figure is representative of at least 3 experiments performed on different experimental days.</CAPTION>

Human bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to 10% cigarette smoke extract for 24 hours or to 0.5  μ M camptothecin for 4 hours, respectively, in LHC-D/RPMI medium. Both floating and attached cells were harvested, combined and used for TUNEL assay (Panel A), DNA content profiling and cell cycle analysis (Panel B), COMET assay (Panel C) and colony formation assay (Panel D). Data presented in panels A, C and D is one representative experiment from at least 4 replicates in both BEAS-2B and HBEC cells. Panel B is an average of 8 different experiments for "control and CSE", and 4 different experiments for camptothecin (CPT) treated. * p  <  0.05, ** p  <  0.01 compared to control.

<CAPTION>Distribution and numbers of neurons in the hippocampus . Confocal laser scanning micrographs were taken from serial horizontal sections through the dorsal  (A)  and the ventral hippocampus  (G)  that were immunostained for NeuN to detect the nuclei of neuronal cells. To quantify cytoarchitectural variations in the structure of neuronal cell layers, the numbers of neighbours for any given cell were determined as a measure of density of cell packing. In the dorsal hippocampus of WT animals (n = 6), fewer cells were surrounded by a high number of neighbours, i.e. neurons showed a more sparse pattern  (C-F) . By contrast, in  Ctsk -/-  mice (n = 6) the ventral part of the hippocampus showed a significantly more sparse neuronal distribution  (G-L) . This patterning difference was most pronounced in the DG  (C and I) , CA2  (E and K)  and CA1  (F and L) , although all regions exhibited significant differences in the patterning of the neuronal layer between the two genotypes (p  <  0.001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).  (B)  Numbers of neurons were increased in DG, CA3 and CA2 regions in the dorsal part of the hippocampus of  Ctsk -/-  compared to WT mice, whereas neuronal numbers were decreased in the CA1 region of  Ctsk -/-  mice.  (H)  Fewer neurons were observed in DG and CA1 region in the ventral area of the hippocampus of  Ctsk -/-  mice. Bars - 200  μ m  (A, G) .

Resected valve with  B. henselae  infection showing large and non-inflammatory vegetation on the valvular surface (A, hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification  ×  100). The diagnosis of vegetation was made by the presence of fibrinous material with numerous darkly stained bacilli (arrows in Figure 1B) consistent with  Bartonella , organized in numerous clusters (B, Warthin-Starry silver staining, original magnification  ×  400). The bacteria (arrows in Figure 1C) are detected by immunohistochemical analysis in an extracellular location inside the valvular vegetation (C, polyclonal antibody anti- B. henselae  with hematoxylin counterstain, original magnification  ×  200). Resected lymph node showed a necrotizing lymphadenitis. Numerous microabscesses composed of fragmented neutrophils were observed in homogenous necrotic areas. Necrotic regions were surrounded by a ring of macrophages and epithelioid histiocytes to form stellate inflammatory granulomas consistent with cat-scratch disease (D, hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification  ×  100).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Representative photomicrographs of the  carcinogen-treated groups  from the premalignant study . From L-R: whole mounts (40 × , left panels), H & E's (200 × , middle panels) and BrdU staining (200 × , right panel). Genotype, treatment, and diets are indicated at each row: [A] WT/DMBA control diet; [B]  WT/DMBA/AUR diet; [C] KO/DMBA control diet; [D]  KO/DMBA/AUR diet. All photomicrographs were uniformly reduced in size to 70% of the original picture in order to fit into the figure panels. Note, in the BrdU study, some background staining occurred, but this was also detected in the no primary antibody control (data not shown). Nuclear staining of epithelial cells was not observed in the background control.</CAPTION>

Intra- and extracellular mucin was present in all examined sections (panel E). A high fraction of pKi67 positive cells was detected, and in this PMP-1 passage 3 tumor 10 – 50% of tumor cell nuclei were stained (panel F).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>ATF3 expression in myoepithelial cells of BK5.ATF3 mice . (a). A paraffin section (4  μ m) of a mammary gland from an 8 week old BK5.ATF3 virgin female was stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies to CK5 (Texas Red, red) and CK8 (FITC, green) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. (b-e). Sections were also treated with a primary antibody to ATF3, then stained using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and a chromogenic substrate that produces a brown stain, and counterstained with hematoxylin. Mammary gland from a BK5.ATF3 transgenic female (b,d) was compared with a non-transgenic littermate (c,e). Scale bars = 100  μ m; scale bar in panel c applies to panels b and c, scale bar in panel e applies to panels d and e. (f). Nuclear extracts were analyzed for ATF3 protein expression by immunoblotting as described in Materials and Methods. Equal amounts of protein from mammary glands of non-transgenic mice (lane WT) or BK5. ATF3 mice of line 1 (lane 1), line 2 (lane 2), line 3 (lane 3), or line 4 (lane 4) were analyzed. As a positive control, an extract from RAW 264.7 cells was analyzed (lane C).  β -actin was used as loading control. An ATF3-specific band was detected in the 20 – 25 KD size range in the BK5.ATF3 mammary gland extracts and in the positive control extract; this band was barely detectable in extracts from non-transgenic mice (lane 1). The ATF3 band was abolished by preincubation with the ATF3 blocking peptide (not shown).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Biomarkers of DNA damage in human lymphocytes: a) Structural chromosomal aberrations (CA) are typical of cancer cells, probably as a manifestation of genetic instability. b) Micronuclei (MN) can originate from chromosome breaks or whole chromosomes that fail to engage with the mitotic spindle when the cell divides. Therefore, the micronucleus test can be considered just as a real "biological dosimeter" for evaluating both numerical and structural chromosome aberrations. c) Sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) represent symmetrical exchanges between sister chromatids; generally they do not result in chromosomal alterations of the genetic information. c) The Comet assay is an especially sensitive method for detecting DNA single-strand breaks and oxidative DNA damage in individual cells. The entity of the DNA damage is proportional to the length of the comet.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>(a) "Cutaneous" reaction pattern of CHC in a skin flap . Thick orthokeratotic plaque (asterisk) covers epidermis (E) of increased thickness. Bacterial colonies (arrowhead) are seen on the surface of the plaque. Although the plaque is largely compact, superficial (vertical arrows) and deep (horizontal arrow) areas of variably decreased/lost intercellular cohesion (dyscohesion) are seen. While the superficial dyscohesion leads to desquamation of individual cornified cells, lateral expansion/"burrowing" of deep dyscohesion could eventually effect the loss of the overlying non-dyscohesive cornified heap. The processes would result in formation of surface ditches.  (b)  Even without special staining, candidal hyphae deeply "entombed" within the plaque, are discernible. Note the nuclear "ghosts" of the polygonal cornified keratinocytes.  (c)  The septate and grouped hyphae (arrowheads) are highlighted on PAS-staining. Compare the unstained nuclear ghosts (arrow) with the viable haematoxyphilic nuclei in the right lower corner of the photomicrograph.</CAPTION>

Cell suspensions were cultured for 6 days on a quartz substrate coated with a calcium phosphate film in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, 20 ng/ml) and receptor activator of NF- κ B ligand (RANKL, 100 ng/ml). At day 6 media were removed, cultures were provided with fresh media and stimulated as indicated (M-CSF, 20 ng/ml; CXCL12, 0.5 ng/ml; AMD3100, 25  μ g/ml). Cells were removed from the quartz substrate after 2 days and resorption pits were visualized by light microscopy. The resorbed area was measured by a bioquant image analysis system. Bars represent the mean area resorbed by 1 osteoclast (average  ±  standard error of the mean), measured as the area of 1 resorption pit. The asterisk represents p  <  0.001 compared with the M-CSF condition (Mann-Whitney U-test).

<CAPTION>The signs and symptoms of arthritis are caused by distinct processes in the joint. Synovitis with extensive inflammation is characteristic. Formation of pannus tissue and activation of osteoclasts contributes to joint destruction. Tissue remodeling is characterized by new cartilage and bone formation eventually leading to ankylosis. The images presented were obtained from mice with methylated bovine serum albumin-induced arthritis (inflammation and destruction) and from mice with spontaneous ankylosing enthesitis (remodeling).</CAPTION>

The MCSG, NESG, and NYSGXRC consortia have comparably greater authorship of publications, with individual laboratories clustering together. The BSGC and JCSG centers include nearly all participating authors on every publication, as seen by dense clusters with heavy edge weights. At the other extreme, the TB consortium is a loose collaboration of many groups of different scientists who tend to publish separately.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>A-C. Normal pattern of neurogenesis and cell cycle progression in GMR-GAL4. Cells enter S-phase of the SMW after column 0, and most cells (~90%) perform mitosis and degrade their Cyclin B between columns 3 – 5. Arrowhead indicates column 0 in the morphogenetic furrow. D-F. In GMR-GAL4 > RasV12, ectopic neurogenesis occurs after the Second Mitotic Wave is completed (arrow). 100% of SMW cells perform mitosis and degrade Cyclin B in this genotype[11]. G-I. GMR-p21 prevents entry into the SMW, so that no cells contain Cyclin B posterior to the morphogenetic furrow [10] . Ectopic neurogenesis is still delayed until after column 5, however (arrow).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Distribution and numbers of neurons in the hippocampus . Confocal laser scanning micrographs were taken from serial horizontal sections through the dorsal  (A)  and the ventral hippocampus  (G)  that were immunostained for NeuN to detect the nuclei of neuronal cells. To quantify cytoarchitectural variations in the structure of neuronal cell layers, the numbers of neighbours for any given cell were determined as a measure of density of cell packing. In the dorsal hippocampus of WT animals (n = 6), fewer cells were surrounded by a high number of neighbours, i.e. neurons showed a more sparse pattern  (C-F) . By contrast, in  Ctsk -/-  mice (n = 6) the ventral part of the hippocampus showed a significantly more sparse neuronal distribution  (G-L) . This patterning difference was most pronounced in the DG  (C and I) , CA2  (E and K)  and CA1  (F and L) , although all regions exhibited significant differences in the patterning of the neuronal layer between the two genotypes (p  <  0.001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).  (B)  Numbers of neurons were increased in DG, CA3 and CA2 regions in the dorsal part of the hippocampus of  Ctsk -/-  compared to WT mice, whereas neuronal numbers were decreased in the CA1 region of  Ctsk -/-  mice.  (H)  Fewer neurons were observed in DG and CA1 region in the ventral area of the hippocampus of  Ctsk -/-  mice. Bars - 200  μ m  (A, G) .

<CAPTION>Panel A . Intraoperative brain images in April 2004. An axial T1-weighted image after gadolinium injection (left-hand side) shows lesions in the gray matter of the left temporo-parietal lobe and right occipital lobe (place of biopsy). These images show slight enhancement of the lesions particularly in the meninges and the presence of mass effect. An axial T2-weighted image (center) and a FLAIR image (right-hand side) show better details of the lesions.  Panel B . Brain MRI images, 5 months after discharge. Axial T-1 weighted image after gadolinium injection (left-hand side) showed important improvement in gray matter lesions. However, images in T2-weighted (center), and FLAIR (right-hand side) showed presence of new high-signal-intensity lesions in the white matter of the right frontal lobe and left occipital lobe. A widening of the right ventricle compared to the figure in Panel A can be observed.  Panel C.  Brain MRI images, 7 months after discharge. Axial T-1 weighted image after gadolinium injection (left-hand side) shows normal appearance. Images in T2-weighted (center) and FLAIR (right-hand side) reveal regression of the white matter changes; however discrete widening of the right ventricle is still present.</CAPTION>

An axial T1-weighted image after gadolinium injection (left-hand side) shows lesions in the gray matter of the left temporo-parietal lobe and right occipital lobe (place of biopsy). These images show slight enhancement of the lesions particularly in the meninges and the presence of mass effect. An axial T2-weighted image (center) and a FLAIR image (right-hand side) show better details of the lesions.  Panel B . Brain MRI images, 5 months after discharge. Axial T-1 weighted image after gadolinium injection (left-hand side) showed important improvement in gray matter lesions. However, images in T2-weighted (center), and FLAIR (right-hand side) showed presence of new high-signal-intensity lesions in the white matter of the right frontal lobe and left occipital lobe. A widening of the right ventricle compared to the figure in Panel A can be observed.  Panel C.  Brain MRI images, 7 months after discharge. Axial T-1 weighted image after gadolinium injection (left-hand side) shows normal appearance. Images in T2-weighted (center) and FLAIR (right-hand side) reveal regression of the white matter changes; however discrete widening of the right ventricle is still present.</CAPTION>

The usual grading of pericardial effusion takes into account the diastolic separation between epicardium and pericardium: 1. small =  <  10 mm corresponding to 300 ml, 2. moderate = 10 – 20 mm corresponding to 500 ml, 3. severe =  >  20 mm corresponding to  >  700 ml). In this patient the diastolic separation is  <  10 mm (both in long and in short-axis vies), indicating mild pericardial effusion.

<CAPTION>Autoscopic seizures . A: slow (3.5 Hz) right centro-parietal activity. Patient reported an unclear change in the awareness of her body, a feeling of strangeness. B: abrupt discharges constituted by polyspikes and sharp-waves of 100-120 uV in amplitude and in reversal phase at P4 lead. Patient reported a sudden appearance of her entire body exactly in front of her, in upright position. The double was at the same level of her real body, i.e. the real body was not felt elevated relatively to her double (unlike in out of body experience). She reported a bilocation state. The double was motionless and silent. C-D: after a few seconds the discharge involved right fronto-temporal channels and then left parieto-occipital channel. The discharge lasted about 30 seconds. We noted an impairment of consciousness. E: the final critic activity was constituted by right temporo-parietal spike and slow wave complexes (3.5-4 Hz). Patient reported again un unclear perception of her body, but the double had vanished. F: slow generalized interictal activity recorded by a previous EEG (3-3.5 Hz).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Gas phase NO release from stimulated SAECs/A549 cells and total nitrate/nitrite in culture medium . Data is the mean values from 3 donors. A: Representative real-time NO signal from the NO analyzer. Raw analyzer data was smoothed using a wavelet transformation, and the steady state value determined from an exponential fit as previously described [ 8 ]. B: Cytomix or IL-13 was added to the SAEC culture medium at t = 0. Gas phase NO concentration and was measured at different times (0, 6, 10, 24, 30, 34 hours) up to 48 hours, and the NO steady state flux was calculated as described in the Methods. Very low level of basal NO flux was detected from SAECs (n = 6, data from 6 measurements). NO flux was increased by cytomix treatment within 6 hours and reached a peak at 10 hours (n = 10 or 11). At t = 24 hours, 30  μ M iNOS inhibitor L-NIL was added to the culture medium in some experiments leading to a significant reduction of NO flux (n = 4). IL-13 induced modest increase in NO flux in SAECs (n = 8 or 9, *P  <  0.05 compared to control group, #P  <  0.05 compared to cytomix stimulated group). C: Total nitrite+nitrate content in SAECs culture medium after 48 hours exposure to either cytomix or IL-13 was measured (n = 10, *P  <  0.05 compared to control group). D: Cytomix or IL-13 was added to A549 cell culture medium at t = 0. NO flux was increased by cytomix treatment within 6 hours and reached a peak at 10 hours. IL-13 did not alter the NO flux (n = 4, *P  <  0.05 compared to control group). E: Total nitrite+nitrate content in A549 cell culture medium after 48 hours exposure to either cytomix or IL-13 was measured (n = 8, *P  <  0.05 compared to control group).</CAPTION>

(A) Example of EEG sleep recording in the first hour, after the lights had been turned on, in the recording chamber for both CaMKIV over-expressed mice and WT mice. However, if the mouse had been trace fear conditioned, slow delta oscillation (1-4 Hz) enhancements were detected in the recording for CaMKIV over-expressedmice but not WT mice. (B) Group data showing that CaMKIV over-expressed mice have elevated slow delta oscillation power above that of WT mice during NREM sleep in the recording chamber across an 8 hour span. A subset of the CaMKIV over-expressed and WT mice were then recorded after trace fear training during the same time points of the next day. CaMKIV over-expressed mice were found to have elevated slow delta oscillations above that of the first hour of their pre-conditioning. However, WT mice did not show a similar enhancement. * is  p  <  0.05 compared to WT for the corresponding hour, # is  p  <  0.05 between pre and post-conditioning for the corresponding hour. (C) CaMKIV over-expressed and WT mice had similar 4-7.5 Hz power during REM sleep prior to and following trace fear conditioning. Four-7.5 HZ power was averaged across 4 hour time periods.</CAPTION>

IC90s are expressed in ng/ml against the mefloquine-sensitive W2 strain of  P. falciparum . Maximum whole and free brain concentrations in male FVB mice after iv dosing (5 mg/kg) are expressed in ng/g. Residual plasma concentrations at 24 h after iv dosing are expressed as a percentage relative to the 5 minute time point. One in 5 diamines (20%, WR308396) had acceptable potency. One in 5 diamines had acceptable whole (20%, WR319535) and free (20%, WR319535) brain levels relative to mefloquine. WR319535 exhibited a half-life longer than mefloquine after oral dosing (data not shown). For this reason we have assumed that the residual plasma concentrations at 24 h of all (100%) of the diamines may be indicative of long half-lives.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Genealogy for five sampled sequences illustrating how closed intervals, | s i |, and  Σ i | s i | are calculated by the KM (a) and KM' (b) models . The closed and open segments of each bar denote the available versus missing or ignored regions of its sequence as scored over the range of (0:1). | s i | are calculated from these scores (numbers next to branches) and  Σ i  | s i | is then determined as their sum for each  T j  (values on the far right). In contrast, the KM' model (b) rescores the sampled sequences and the ( n  - 1) basal ancestral sequence of this asymmetrical genealogy (the diamond) as  ∅ . Thus, these sequences make no contribution to  Σ i  | s i | as their | s i | = 0.0. The KM' model also ignores the first 20% of the sequence for the common ancestor of the two leftmost sampled sequences. This region is missing from the leftmost sampled allele and thereby fails the "below" half of the "above and below" test (see text).</CAPTION>

The number of spots having a difference of intensity from one scan to the next in a series of eight successive scans (see  P f, s, n  in materials and methods) is plotted as a function of that difference, for slide # 3 . Each series of bars in the histogram increases by a relative difference of 1.25 percent of the adjusted intensity. Bars in light grey represent the results for images with one acquisition; bars in grey represent those for images obtained with two acquisitions of the same line and those in black for images obtained with three acquisitions. The broken line corresponds to a difference of ten percent from scan to scan. Part A is for Cy3 images (532 nm); part B for Cy5 images (635 nm).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Comparison of methods for predicting protein-protein interactions . The top three panels plot the average precision (TP/(TP+FP)) as a function of recall (TP/(TP+FN)) for the core, core subset and small-scale benchmarks. Each precision is averaged across the 15 splits of 3 × 5cv, and estimated for test sets for which the negative examples are not downsampled. In the lower three panels, an edge from method  A  to  B  indicates that method  A  outperforms method  B  at  p  >  0.5 according to a Wilcoxon signed rank test applied to the area under the precision-recall curve, computed separately for each of the 15 splits of 3 × 5cv. Redundant edges have been removed for clarity; i.e., the figure shows the transitive reduction of the full graph.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Logistic regressions of the probability of detection of gene expression differences from simulated data. Logistic regressions of the frequency of affirmative significance call over log 2  factor of difference in gene expression. The logistic model plotted is that log e ( p /(1 -  p )) =  mx  +  b , where  x  is the log 2  factor of difference in gene expression. Cross symbols represent actual data points. Each is placed at its estimated expression level, either at the top of the plot. When identified as significant (S), or at the bottom when identified as not significant(NS). Logistic regressions are of statistical significance calls A) on the "true" factors of fold change from which data was simulated. The model has a highly significant fit ( χ 2  = 884.5,  P  <  0.0001). The estimated intercept for the log odds,  b , of an affirmative significance call is -16.4 (significant, P  <  0.0001). This corresponds to a probability of a positive call of 0.02, which is the observed average false-positive rate. The estimated slope with log 2  factor of difference in gene expression,  m , is 12.5 (significant, P  <  0.0001). B) on the factors of difference estimated from the simulated data. The model has a highly significant fit ( χ 2  = 890.5,  P  <  0.0001). The estimated intercept for the log odds,  b , of a significant call versus no significant call is -3.9 (significant, P  <  0.0001), and the estimated slope with log2 factor of difference in gene expression,  m , is 10.7 (significant, P  <  0.0001).</CAPTION>

Each data point on a curve is an average over 100 trials of generating and clustering data. Four clustering variations are considered for each data set: the CORE error model, a uniform error model, a Euclidean distance between pairs of expression profiles, and the error-weighted similarity measure between pairs of expression profiles. (A) The figure depicts the results for normally distributed synthetic data generated from 50 classes. (B) The figure depicts the results from periodic time series synthetic data generated from 4 classes. (C) The figure shows the results of clustering 904  E. coli  genes belonging to 275 multi-gene operons based on expression data from 55 experiments. (D) Based on expression data from 20 experimental conditions, the figure shows the results of clustering 205 yeast genes which have each been annotated with one of four functional classifications.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Use of NVSA for improving normalization accuracy . The NVSA variable selection function (denoted as nv) was used prior to quantile, lowess, or xcorr normalization analysis of Dnl data series. ( A ) The percentage of variant genes filtered out by the NVSA variable selection procedure increases along with the percentage of gene effects. ( B ) Normalization accuracy measured by the mean relative error versus the total percentage of gene effects represented by DEG. Up, down, up/down indicate the gene effects as up-, down-, and an equal mixture of both, respectively. Errors that are greater than 20% are not shown to allow a better view of details in the low error region.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>The influence of queen presence on brain  Kr-h1  levels in workers .  A . In the first experiment we compared workers from queenright colonies and workers of similar age and genotype that developed in small queenless groups. Data represent mean  ±  standard error of mean. The number of individual brains used in each sample is shown in the base of each bar. P-values above plots were obtained from unpaired t-test analyses.  B . In the second experiment we compared queenless and queenright workers that developed in colonies with similar worker and brood populations, but differing in the presence or absence of an egg-laying queen. Sample size was 6 bees/colony. Groups with different letters are significantly different in a one-way ANOVA followed by a LSD post hoc test (P  <  0.001 for both tests).</CAPTION>

Plots show the probability of bridging predicted by logistic regressions (continuous line) using either  a)  body mass or  b)  carapace width as predictor variables. Each dot corresponds to the trial of one single individual (females solid circles, males empty circles). To distinguish between males and females, successful bridging takes the value of 1 for females and 1.05 for males, while unsuccessful bridging takes the value of 0 for females and 0.05 for males. The red arrows show the threshold beyond which the predicted probability of bridging is les than 5%, and the red small vertical lines mark the limits of the confidence interval for this threshold.</CAPTION>

The branching pattern of Fig. 9b and corresponding MVS representation of Fig. 9c in terms of S 11, i ( o ) and S 14, i ( o ). Here, the triplet of probes  o  =  1 ,  a  =  11 , and  b  =  14  were used. The endpoints ( 8 ,  9 ),  10 ,  12 , and  13  are degenerated into the positions of the nodes  2 , 3 , 7 , and  5 , respectively. When the pairwise differences satisfy orthogonality, the scatter plots are placed on the orthogonal lines A, B and C. Convergent evolution between the two branches ( 3 →   10 ) and ( 7 →   11 ) underestimates the pairwise difference between  10  and  11 , causing a deviation of point  10  from the orthogonal line A, which moves it to the position of the triangle.</CAPTION>

Cx, castrated mice, 10 days post castration, n = 12; Pre-Cx, pre-castration, day 0 of castration, n = 15. Exception:  LRIG1  gene expression in Cx samples was represented by 11 mice. Fold-change was calculated by normalizing the mean normalized expression (MNE) of transcripts in the Pre-Cx sample to the castrate sample. In doing this, the Cx sample fold-change became one and standard deviation (SD) zero. Error bars represent  ±  SD. [*] Asterisks indicate the significant differential gene expression with respect to Cx according to the Two-Sample Student's T-test (p  ≤  0.05) for unequal variance.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Complementation in error occurrence . An expected frequency of multiple errors was calculated based on the assumption that each error is independent using the formula p = C(SER) M , where SER = observed single error rate, M = number of mutated nt in sequence, and C = total number of possible erroneous sequence combinations. C = N!/(M!x(N-M)!), where N = number of nucleotides in the sequence. The expected frequency of multiple mutations is plotted against the observed frequency in experimental samples either for data sets not filtered based on phred score or filtered at a q = 30, and for the presence of between 2 and 10 mutated nt for q = 0 and 2 and 4 for q = 30 (no events were observed with 4-10 mutations for q = 30 filtered data).</CAPTION>

Taking all sites together, two preferential locations of the centers are found (blue). By separating the locations of the peaks of 28 based on the strand on which the 19-mer contributing to the P28 pattern occurred, the two peaks were disentangled. For black we used P28 patterns in which the short sequence was found on the plus strand. For red we used P28 patterns in which the short sequence was found on the minus strand.

The 22 ENU-induced mutations identified in this study (see Table 1) by TGCE analysis of heteroduplexed PCR products produced electropherogram patterns that can be divided into four general categories based on the number and shape of the peaks. Shown are representative electropherograms from each category, which include:  (A)  three peaks (CMMB #1128, 484-bp amplicon,  Scnm1 );  (B)  two peaks of approximately equal intensity (CMMB #3789, 484-bp amplicon,  Scnm1 );  (C)  two peaks with lower intensity of the heteroduplex peak (CMMB #1954, 336-bp amplicon,  Usp29 ): and  (D)  a shoulder on the main peak (CMMB #1176, 335-bp amplicon,  Antxr1 ). In each of the four panels the electropherogram on the top is from the indicated CMMB sample with a heterozygous ENU mutation and the electropherogram on the bottom is from an untreated C57BL/6J control sample. All patterns shown were obtained from first-pass TGCE screening of unpurified PCR products using a single 50 – 60 ° C gradient. Heteroduplex molecules (arrows) denature faster than the homoduplexes as temperature increases during electrophoresis. The distribution of electropherogram patterns observed for the 22 mutations can be categorized as follows:  (A)  2,  (B)  4,  (C)  12, and  (D)  4 mutations. Thus, 82% of the profiles exhibited two or more peaks and the remaining 18% were shoulders.</CAPTION>

A modified image from the UCSC cow genome browser (March 2005, Btau_2.0) showing BTC1_14RD and its alternately spliced product BTC1_130FL aligned to the cattle genome (Contig455) [GenBank: AAFC02000448 ]. Cattle BAC AC146804 [25]  aligned to the same region using BLAT (regions of similarity shown with vertical bars). A track for human proteins is shown to demonstrate that there are no known human homologs in this region. A scaled track for cattle ESTs (partial representation of "squish mode" due to the large number of ESTs) shows high support for alternatively spliced cattle transcripts encoded in this region. Bottom panel (B). A modified image from the UCSC human genome browser (May 2004, Hg17) showing the  in silico  anchoring of BTC1_14RD, represented as a block arrow, to a subtelomeric region of HSA19q on the basis of flanking sequence similarity in cattle BAC AC146804. This region is syntenic to a segment of BTA18 (shown as a separate track at the top). BTC1_130FL anchors in the same region (not shown to maintain clarity of the figure). The assumptive map location of the gene encoding the artiodactyl-specific transcript  Ast1  [GenBank: AY427788 ] is also shown. No significant flanking match was identified in Contig455 (due to its shorter length). Unmodified UCSC Genome Browser tracks for known human proteins, Genscan genes, retroposed genes, conserved sequences, and segmental duplication are shown.</CAPTION>

Bottom Left: Heatmap visualization of the genes according to pairwise Euclidean distance. Probes 1 – 16 are Affymetrix, 17 is Agilent, and 18 is Codelink. Probes 5 – 8 (green outline) are distant from the rest of the probes in the set, creating a white cross in the symmetric matrix. The rest of the probes are all in high agreement with each other with short distances between expression vectors. Bottom Right: Log2 signal intensity of the replicates. The signal intensities of the misbehaving probes, outlined in green, do not show the same high degree of separability between the control and treatment groups that is exhibited by the rest of the probes. The signal intensity graph confirms that these probes behave differently and should form their own cluster, as found in the heatmap.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Efficient target gene silencing with reduced OAS1 induction and lower shRNA expression.  Total RNA was isolated from IS-1 cells (CTRL) or IS-1 cells 4 days after transduction with U6PT, sh319 or sh321 vectors. After reverse transcription, cDNA was analysed for expression of PAI-2 (A) and OAS1 (B). Data were generated by QRT-PCR, each target gene was detected in triplicate, error bars represent the standard deviation of mean values. 1 ml or 0.1 ml of each lentiviral vector stock was used, hence the designations 1 and 0.1. Vector titres were approximately 10 6  transducing units per ml resulting in a multiplicity of transduction of approximately 10 for 1 ml used or 1 for 0.1 ml used. In C, shRNA expression was detected in total cell RNAs using a modified RNase protection protocol. Total RNA was mixed with radiolabelled probes for hybridization and RNase protection. Samples were resolved on a 15 % Acrylamide/8M Urea/TBE gel and RNase protected probes detected by autoradiography. Lane 1 shows the Mir-16 probe without RNase digestion or target RNA, lane 2 is as lane 1 with RNase digestion and lane 3 as lane 2 with U6PT-transduced cell RNA as hybridization target. Lane 4 shows the sh3 probe without RNase digestion or target RNA, lane 5 as lane 4 with RNase digestion and lane 6 as lane 5 with U6PT-transduced cell RNA as hybridization target. In lane 7 sh321-transduced cell RNA was used as the hybridization target for the sh3 probe with RNase digestion, and lane 8 is as lane 7 except that cells were transduced with 10-fold less vector titre (sh321 1 and sh321 0.1). Known nucleotide lengths (Ntds.) for the probes and the protected Mir-16 endogenous RNA are marked.</CAPTION>

For simplicity the alias BIM is used in the figure instead of the approved gene symbol BCL2L11. The transcript originating in the BIM promoter 1 region defines a novel BIM exon comprising sequences covered by Genbank ESTs and spliced onto the first coding exon of BIM.  B . BIM-P1 sequences can drive transcription of a luciferase reporter when transiently transfected in HEK293 cells. pBIM-P1 constructs (-1918 relatively to the HEK293 transcript initiation site) demonstrate that the sequence can drive transcription of the reporter in an orientation-independent manner. *p  <  0.01, Anova: single factor.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Distribution and numbers of neurons in the hippocampus . Confocal laser scanning micrographs were taken from serial horizontal sections through the dorsal  (A)  and the ventral hippocampus  (G)  that were immunostained for NeuN to detect the nuclei of neuronal cells. To quantify cytoarchitectural variations in the structure of neuronal cell layers, the numbers of neighbours for any given cell were determined as a measure of density of cell packing. In the dorsal hippocampus of WT animals (n = 6), fewer cells were surrounded by a high number of neighbours, i.e. neurons showed a more sparse pattern  (C-F) . By contrast, in  Ctsk -/-  mice (n = 6) the ventral part of the hippocampus showed a significantly more sparse neuronal distribution  (G-L) .

After NMDA injection, an increased immunorectivity was detected (B). However, animals overexpressing Cu/Zn SOD showed reduction in nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity (C), while animals overexpressing GFP showed a less pronounced reduction (D). Quantitative analysis confirmed these observations whereby, only animals overexpressing Cu/Zn SOD showed a significant (p  <  0.05) decrease in nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity (E).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Accumulation of flavonoids . Accumulation of flavonoids in vegetative parts of tomato plants was determined by HPLC using standards. Tomato plants were grown for 25 days on rock-wool with complete nutrient supply under continuous light. The rock-wool was rinsed with water to remove previous nutrient solution, and plants were randomly divided in two batches. Half the plants continued with complete nutrient solution, whereas the other half received nutrient solution with no nitrogen. Samples were taken before change of nutrients (day 0) and again after three days. One biological sample was pooled from 3 different plants. Three analytical replicates were run for each sample; standard error was less than 1%. Accumulation of a) rutin and b) kaempferol-3-rutinoside is given as  μ g/g fresh weight (FW).</CAPTION>

On the diagonal panels estimated probability density are given for each variable, together with measurement value for each observation, the latter in the form of vertical lines along the x-axis. The numerical range for each variable is given along both the horizontal and the vertical borders of the matrix plot. The off-diagnal panels allow for each variable to be compared to any other variable, interchanging the ordinate and the abscissa. For each of these bivariate scatterplots a least square linear regression line is fitted. Elliptic data-concentration contours for the fitted bivariate normal distribution are also plotted. For highly correlated data the elliptic shape is elongated, and for uncorrelated data the shape is circular. The contours are plotted at levels 0.5 and 0.9, i.e. 50% of the data is within the inner ellipse, and 90% within the outer one. (The figure was produced by the car package in R.)</CAPTION>

For each of these bivariate scatterplots a least square linear regression line is fitted. Elliptic data-concentration contours for the fitted bivariate normal distribution are also plotted. For highly correlated data the elliptic shape is elongated, and for uncorrelated data the shape is circular. The contours are plotted at levels 0.5 and 0.9, i.e. 50% of the data is within the inner ellipse, and 90% within the outer one. (The figure was produced by the car package in R.)</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Tumor weight following induction of subcutaneous tumors with SRC cells overexpressing either thymosin- β 4 or c-fos . Control tumors were initiated with SRC cells that express the MSCV viral vector with no insert (pMSCV-I-Hygro vector). C-fos tumors were initiated with SRC cells that overexpress c-fos (MSCV-cfos-I-Puro). Thymosin- β 4 tumors were initiated with SRC cells that overexpress thymosin- β 4 (MSCV-Thy β 4-I-Puro). Overexpression of c-fos resulted in the formation of tumors that were significantly smaller than control tumors. The bar represents the average invasion indices of biologic replicates, and the error bars represent the standard deviation of the biologic replicates. '*' Indicates that the tumor weight is significantly different than the tumor weight of the control tumors (p-value  < 0.05 considered significant). n = 10 for control tumors and c-fos tumors. n = 9 for thymosin- β 4 tumors (one animal died prematurely and was found to have multiple chondrosarcoma lung metastases). See Additional file  4  for complete list of tumor weights. (B) Photomicroscopy of histological sections obtained from SRC tumors (20  ×  magnification). Tumors induced from control cells (SRC cells expressing the empty viral vector), and from SRC cells overexpressing either Thymosin- β 4 (Thymosin- β 4 tumor) or c-fos (C-fos tumor). Approximately 30 days following tumor induction animals were sacrificed and tumors were removed for histology. Sections representative of each tumor are shown. All tumors were classified as histologic grade II chondrosarcomas. The SRC cells are stained with Safranin O (red).</CAPTION>

ERK/MAP Kinase 1/2 activation significantly increased in miR-34a treated cells relative to premiR-negative control treated NB1691 luc  cells (p  <  0.01 n = 3). Notably, activated STAT3, JNK and p38 levels tended towards a significant reduction relative to premiR-negative control- treated samples (p = 0.046, 0.07 and 0.009 respectively)</CAPTION>

(D)  Quantitative analysis of MSX2 copy numbers was performed by genomic real-time PCR in 12 selected T-cell lines. The MEF2C locus was used as endogenous control as described previously [ 29 ]. Of note, cell lines CCRF-CEM, HPB-ALL and PEER demonstrate bisected quantities, indicating deletion of one allele of MSX2.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>MIF targeting by antisense transfection results in reduced proliferation and restoration of contact inhibition . The generated LN18 MIF antisense-expressing clones (as1 + as2) and controls (wildtype wt, control - empty vector-transfected - clone c1) were plated on 96-well plates at the same cell number. Growth was measured the following days by amido-black assay. At day 8 the antisense clones as1 and as2 reached 48% (p 0.0043) and 57% (p 0.0007), respectively of the cell density of wildtype cells ( A ). DNA synthesis was significantly (* p  <  0.005) compromised in clones at higher cell densities ( B ).</CAPTION>

Panel C contains horizontal Box and Whisker plots of R-R interval durations for different segments of the ventilatory cycle: I, inspiration; IE, inspiratory to expiratory transition; E, expiration; EI, expiratory to inspiratory transition. The vertical line in each box represents the median value of R-R interval duration for each segment, the left and right boundaries of each box indicate the 25 th  and 75 th  percentile values, and left and right whiskers (resembling error bars) mark the 5 th  and 95 th  percentile values. Asterisks indicated that R-R interval durations occurring in either E or EI segments were significantly longer than those of either I or IE segments. The finding that R-R interval durations of EI segments were significantly longer than those of E segments is signified by the pound sign (#). Panel D shows a representative breath, inspiration down, with superimposed vertical lines indicating the temporal locations of R waves with reference to ventilatory segments: E, EI, I, and IE. The elapsed time between contiguous R waves, i.e., R-R interval durations, is given in seconds.</CAPTION>

The product yield and cell growth performance of the proper strains are shown for the production of 1-butanol from AcCoA (a and b), isobutanol from PYR (c and d), and 1-propanol from OAA (e and f). Open circles represent the data obtained from  E. coli  (iBKEco50); closed red, blue, and orange circles represent the data of original (iBKSce50), merged (iBKSce50 Δ mit), and expanded (iBKSce50+7) models of  S. cerevisiae , respectively. iBKSce50 Δ mit is an hypothetical  S. cerevisiae  model derived by merging the cytosolic and mitochondrial networks into one compartment. iBKSce50+7 is a model of iBKSce50 expanded by the addition of 7  E. coli  reactions. The cell growth rate data were represented by relative values. A cell growth rate level determined from the wild type model was arbitrary set at 1.</CAPTION>

Values are mean (+/- SD) optical density values from anti-MSP-1 1 – 19  ELISAs, normalized against a standard sero-positive plasma pool, for three independent experiments.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Inhibition of LPS-induced maturation by  P. yoelii -infected red blood cells (iRBC) is established between 6 and 18 h . To investigate the kinetics of the iRBC-induced inhibition of DC maturation, DC were pre-incubated for different times (1 to 24 h) with no RBC (white bars), uninfected RBC at 30:1 (grey bars) or iRBC at 30:1 (black bars), and then pulsed with LPS for 18 h. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry for expression of CD40 (A) and CD86 (B). To characterize the kinetics of the iRBC-induced inhibition of cytokine production, DC were pre-incubated for different times (0 to 24 h) with uninfected RBC at 30:1 (white bars) or iRBC at 10:1 (grey bars) or 30:1 (black bars), and then pulsed with LPS 1  μ g/ml. Twenty-four hours after addition of LPS, supernatants of DC cultures were collected and IL-12p70 was quantified by ELISA. Data shows a representative experiment out of two independent experiments.</CAPTION>

Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparison post-test revealed that compared to neonatal ovaries a significant difference in follicle number first appears in the age group of 18 to 24 years. However, no significant difference was observed during the 20 years of optimal reproductive period, between females 18 – 38 years of age. Yet, the ovaries obtained from 40 – 50 year old females showed a significantly lower number of primary follicles vs. all other age groups.

Tg8-A represents the progeny of the founder and 3 F 1  hemizygous males, while progeny from F 2 -F 4  hemizygous males are seen in Tg8-B. Tg8-T represents the total progeny analyzed for the Tg8 line. There is a significant deviation from 1:1 for Tg8-A ( χ 2  = 27.30; P  <  0.001), Tg8-B ( χ 2  = 17.47; P  <  0.001), and Tg8-T ( χ 2  = 41.8; P  <  0.001) all represented by an asterisk; while there was no difference in 1:1 ratios (P  >  0.05) for Tg9 and Tg11, represented by the diamond.  b)  The TRD for Tg8/+ mice does not result from post-zygotic selection against transgene-bearing zygotes, as revealed by the average litter sizes of transgenic lines. In addition to the BAC transgenic lines we included a  Spam1  cDNA transgenic line, Cinn (179), which like Tg9 and Tg11 also had a 1:1 ratio in the progeny. The means for the litters ranged from 6.68 to 8.50 and are shown at the top of the histograms with their SDs at the sides. The highest mean, 8.50  ±  1.51, was seen for Tg8A which had the highest TRD, 2.8:1.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Graphical depiction of how relative rate ratios evolve over time . In panel A, two populations begin a linear process of IMR decline that maintains an equal gap and a constant decrement in IMR at each period. In Panel A, the rate ratio increases asymptotically as the lower rate ratio approaches zero. In panel B, the populations experience exponential decline in IMR with the same coefficient of decay but with population B starting from a higher infant mortality. In Panel B, the gap declines to nearly zero, but the rate ratio remains constant.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>17-AAG inhibits phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, STAT5 and STAT6 (A + B), reduces expression of Jak1, Jak3 and Tyk2 (C) and cHL cell proliferation (D) . cHL cell lines L428, L1236 and HDLM2 were treated with DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) or 5  μ M 17-AAG (17-(Allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, Merck/Calbiochem) for 24 h. STAT tyrosine phosphorylation and Jak expression was analysed by immunoblot as described recently [ 2 ]. (A + B) Phosphorylation of STAT3 (Tyr705) (#9131, Cell Signaling Technology), STAT6 (Tyr641) (#9366, Cell Signaling Technology) (A), STAT1 (Tyr701) (#9172, Cell Signaling Technology) and STAT5 (Tyr694) (#9351, Cell Signaling Technology) (B) is completely abrogated within 24 h. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was only detectable in HDLM2 cells. Protein levels of the STAT molcules remain mostly unaltered (Antibodies: STAT1 (#9171) STAT3 (#9132) (Cell Signaling Technology); STAT5 (610191), STAT6 (610291) (BD Transduction Laboratories)) (C) 17-AAG leads to strong reduction of Jak1, Jak3 and Tyk2 expression in L428, L1236 and HDLM2 cells. Jak2 is enhanced in L428 and L1236 cells and reduced in HDLM2 cells. (D) Incubation of cHL cells with 17-AAG leads strong inhibition of cHL cell proliferation. cHL cell proliferation was measured by  3 H-Thymidin incorporation after 24 h of 17-AAG treatment.  3 H-Thymidin was added 16 h  –  18 h before harvesting. The data is depicted as percentages (DMSO = 100%) and error bars mark the standard deviation of three replications.</CAPTION>

A ) Vaccination with TSA-treated (500 nM for 48 h) and irradiated (2000 Gy) B16 cells prevents B16 tumor generation. Three weeks after s.c. inoculation of TSA-treated [TSA-radiation] or untreated [radiation]  B16 (1  ×  10 5 ) cells in B6 mice (16 in each group); all tumor-free mice were challenged s.c. with wild type B16 (1  ×  10 5 ) cells and observed for 40 days. Percentage of tumor-free mice is presented in the Kaplan-Meier plot.  B ) Suppression of primary tumor growth by TSA-treated and irradiated melanoma vaccine. Groups of B6 mice bearing palpable B16 (5 days tumor growth) were treated s.c. with TSA-treated and irradiated B16 [TSA-radiation] or untreated irradiated B16 (1  ×  10 5  cells) [radiation] in the opposite side of the trunk. A group of tumor-bearing mice did not receive any treatment [no treatment] . The number of tumor-free mice compared to total numbers used in each group is shown in parentheses at 42 days after treatment.  C ) Induction of long-term immunity in tumor-bearing mice treated with epigenetically altered melanoma vaccine. B16 tumor-bearing mice that became tumor-free following vaccine treatment were re-challenged s.c. with wild type B16 (1  ×  10 5  cells). Kaplan-Meier plot shows tumor-free survival of mice in both TSA-radiation and radiation groups after re-challenge.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Specific silencing of hSpt5 expression by RNAi . (A) hSpt5 mRNA is 3261 nucleotides in length. siRNA targeting sequence for hSpt5 was selected from position 407 to 427 relative to the start codon. As a specific control, mutant siRNA containing 2 nucleotide mismatches (underline) between the target mRNA and the antisense of siRNA at the hypothetical cleavage sites of the mRNA was generated. (B) Evaluation of specific hSpt5 siRNA activity by RT-PCR. Total cellular mRNA was prepared from HeLa cells transfected without siRNA or with hSpt5 duplex or control siRNAs and was followed by RT-PCR, as described in Material and Methods. Each RT-PCR reaction included 100 ng total cellular mRNA, gene-specific primer sets for hSpt5 and hCycT1 amplification (0.5  μ M for each primer), 200  μ M dNTP, 1.2 mM MgSO 4  and 1U of RT/platinum  Taq  mix. Primer sets for hSpt5 produced 2.6 kb products while hCycT1 produced 1.8 kb products. RT-PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel and viewed by ethidium bromide staining. RT-PCR products are shown from cells that were not transfected with siRNA (lane 1), or cells transfected with single-stranded antisense hSpt5 siRNA (hSpt5 (AS), lane 2), hSpt5 duplex siRNA (hSpt5 (DS), lane 3), or mismatch hSpt5 duplex siRNA (hSpt5-mm (DS), lane 4). Lane M is a marker lane. (C) Analysis of specific hSpt5 siRNA activity by western blotting. Cell lysates were prepared from HeLa cells mock-transfected without siRNA (lane 1), or transfected with single-stranded antisense hSpt5 siRNA (hSpt5 (AS), lane 2), hSpt5 duplex siRNA (hSpt5 (DS), lane 3), or mismatch hSpt5 duplex siRNA (hSpt5-mm (DS), lane 4). Cell lysates were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Protein contents were detected by immunoblotting assay with antibodies against hSpt5 (top panel) and hCycT1 (lower panel).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Gaps in inhibition compromise glycine/GABA A  receptor-mediated modulation of firing rate only under conditions where shunting can modulate firing rate .  (A)  Whereas the time course of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) directly parallels the change in membrane conductance, the resultant inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) are much slower because of membrane capacitance. The relative brevity of IPSCs coupled with irregularity in the timing of inputs could allow gaps during which little shunting occurs (red stars).  (B)  Most  f out - f exc  curves were unchanged by switching from intermittent inhibition (dashed lines) to constant inhibition (solid lines); the exceptions were those for  E anion  = -65 and -70 mV where constant inhibition caused greater reduction in  f out  than intermittent inhibition. This argues in favor of shunting's ability to modulate firing rate only when average depolarization remains subthreshold (see Results). Constant inhibition was applied as a point conductance in the soma equal to the sum of time-averaged conductances from each inhibitory synapse, repeated at each  f inh .  α  = 1.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Inheritance pattern of the M1627K mutation in DIV/S4 – 5 linker in Na v 1.7 in familial PEPD .  A , Inheritance of PEPD in two generations of a family with PEPD from the UK. Circles denote females; squares denote males, and symbols with diagonal line denote deceased individuals. The proband is indicated by an arrow. Blackened symbols indicate subjects affected with PEPD.  B , Sequence traces of a segment of exon 26 in the region which encodes M1627. Left trace shows homozygous T4879 from exon 26 of the unaffected brother of the proband. Right trace shows heterozygous T4879A in exon 26 from the proband. This missense mutation leads to M1627K substitution. In ( A ), a (+) symbol denotes subjects heterozygous for the T4879A mutation in exon 26, and a (-) symbol denotes subjects without the mutation. Inheritance of PEPD segregates with the T4879A heterozygosity.  C , Sequence alignment of DIV/S4 – S5 linker from human sodium channels. The M1627K substitution in this family with PEPD is noted in the sequence from Na v 1.7. The M1476I from a family with cold-induced myotonia occurs at the corresponding site as M1627 in Na v 1.4. The M1652R from a family with LQT-3 occurs at the adjacent methionine residue in Na v 1.5 (M1628 in Na v 1.7).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>The antinociceptive effects of PPPA in rats with compression of the trigeminal nerve root . The effects of PPPA, a competitive NR2A antagonist, on mechanical allodynia (A, B) and hyperalgesia (C, D) in rats with compression of the trigeminal nerve root (n = 8 in each treatment group). The intracisternal administration of vehicle did not affect air-puff thresholds in either ipsilateral or contralateral side. However, 1 or 10  μ g injections of PPPA significantly increased the air-puff threshold in a dose-dependent manner both ipsilateral (A) and contralateral (B) to the compression of the trigeminal nerve root. The anti-allodynic effects of PPPA were maintained for one hour after a 1  μ g injection of PPPA and six hours after a 10  μ g dose of PPPA. The intracisternal administration of 1 or 10  μ g of PPPA also significantly decreased the pin-prick scores on both sides (C, D). The anti-hyperalgesic effects of PPPA had completely recovered by six hours after the 10  μ g PPPA injection. *P  <  0.05, vehicle-vs. PPPA-treated groups.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Up-regulation of the expression of TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR9, NOD1, and NOD2 in human PBMCs in response to anti-PR3 Abs . PBMCs were stimulated with murine anti-human PR3 Abs (1  μ g/ml, filled graphs) or an isotype-matched control IgG (1  μ g/ml, bold line). After 6 h of incubation, the expression of cell-surface TLR2 and TLR4 and intracellular TLR3, TLR7, TLR9, NOD1, and NOD2, was assessed by flow cytometry. The thin lined curve is the staining with a control Ab. The results presented are representative of four different experiments.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Quenching of HRP-generated light output by an antioxidant .  A:  Light generation of the HRP-catalysed luminol reaction was triggered by the addition of H 2 O 2  (at time t 0  = -36 s). The reaction is quenched by the addition of an antioxidant when a constant output signal is established. Here Trolox ™  (( ± )-6-Hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid) a water soluble derivative of tocopherol (vitamin E) was used. The antioxidant is oxidised by H 2 O 2  thus inhibiting the HRP-catalysed reaction. When the antioxidant is depleted, the HRP reaction resumes and the light signal recovers.  B : The time point of signal recovery t r  depends on the amount of added antioxidant and is defined here as the time where the rate of signal increase is maximum. The curves here are derived from the curves in A and represent the first derivative of the running mean (n = 10) on the raw data. Luminescence is given here in counts per second (cps) and its recovery in cps per s.</CAPTION>

Peaks connected by red lines and black bold lines are regarded as identical TDFs by the clustering-based peak alignment technique. Note that peak alignment subjectively failed in the range (124 – 126 bp) and that visual evaluation is also difficult because of the high variation in fragment lengths for individual TDFs.

<CAPTION>The activity of NKCC1 regulates the migration speed of RMS neuroblasts .  (A)  Plot showing the average migration speed of neuroblasts during a 3 hour recording session. Three groups are plotted: control (transduced with a control non-target shRNA sequence), bumetanide (transduced with a control non-target shRNA sequence and incubated in 10  μ M bumetanide), and shNKCC1 (transduced with shNKCC1).  (B)  Photomicrograph of tangentially migrating GFP +  neuroblasts in the RMS. The RMS was aligned horizontally so that changes along the x-axis represent displacement towards or away from the OB. Scale bar: 100  μ m. Insets: detail of the directionality of the leading process in migrating neuroblasts. Scale bars: 10  μ m.  (C)  Analysis of the migration directionality during the experimental session in the groups of cells described in (A). Displacement towards the SVZ is given a negative value whereas movements towards the OB are positive. Each point represents the total distance covered by one cell during the experimental session and the cells' initial position is at the origin. A red diamond represents the median value for each group. For this and the following figures * P  <  0.05 and ** P  <  0.01.</CAPTION>

From the ROC curve in Figure 3a it appears that the EST was assessed 4 in 86% of the women before EA and in 77% of the 22 women after EA. It is also obvious that the median EST was 3 (50% of the 22 women) both before and after EA. The ROC is nearly close to the main diagonal indicating that there was no systematic change among the women in the assessed EST before compared to after EA. The ROC curve in Figure 3b indicates systematic change both in position and concentration in assessed EST among the men.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Anti-IgM-dependent stimulation of CH1 cells leads to a poor activation of the signaling responses and induces cell cycle arrest . Panel A shows the histograms representing the distribution of cells in each phase of the cell cycle observed by FACS analysis performed 16 hours after a 1 h stimulation of CH1 cells with anti-IgM. An arrest in cell cycle is clearly evident here, with a greater than 2-fold increase in the G1 phase population. Also shown in the inset is the result of a Western blot analysis revealing accumulation of p27 upon anti-IgM stimulation over the course of time. Panel B depicts the activation profiles of fourteen signaling intermediates probed by Western blots (see text for details and Additional File  1 : Supplemental Fig. S1A) after anti-IgM stimulation. The plot represents mean value of quantified, normalized fold change in phosphorylation of the signaling intermediates in a time dependant manner obtained from three individual replicates and the over all S.D observed was  <  10%. Also refer Additional File  1 : Supplemental Fig. S1B for a detailed plot of the figure. An Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the set of early induced genes upon anti-IgM stimulation of CH1 cells is shown in Panel C. This network depicts the core module identified by IPA based on the list of early-induced genes used as the seed nodes. Here, the nodes in red represent the over-expressed genes while those in green are those whose expression was found to suppressed (Detailed key in Additional file  1 ). The canonical pathways identified by IPA for the set of early induced genes in CH1 cells and their corresponding significant levels of contribution by the early induced genes is shown in Panel D.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Analysis of bistability in the gene regulatory network underlying B cell terminal differentiation (see Additional File  1 : Supplementary Material for model details) .  (A)  Steady-state stimulus-response curves between Blimp-1 and Pax5 under zero LPS and TCDD. The red curve was obtained with Blimp-1 level as the independent variable (i.e., stimulus) and the steady-state level of Pax5 as the response; the blue curve was obtained with Pax5 level as the independent variable and the steady-state level of Blimp-1 as the response. The blue curve represents an ultrasensitive response of Blimp-1 to Pax5 due to the presence of the Bcl-6/Blimp-1 double-negative feedback loop. The ultrasensitivity enables the blue curve to intersect with the red curve at three points, indicative of bistability. Intersection point 1 represents the stable B cell state; intersection point 3 represents the stable plasma cell state; and intersection point 2 is an unstable steady state.  (B)  Bifurcation analysis using AP-1p (active form of AP-1) as the independent parameter. Vertical arrows indicate that there is a deterministic threshold value of AP-1p required to turn on the bistable switch. Leftward arrows indicate that the bistable switch is irreversible even when AP-1p drops back to the basal level of 100.</CAPTION>

However, if the mouse had been trace fear conditioned, slow delta oscillation (1-4 Hz) enhancements were detected in the recording for CaMKIV over-expressedmice but not WT mice. (B) Group data showing that CaMKIV over-expressed mice have elevated slow delta oscillation power above that of WT mice during NREM sleep in the recording chamber across an 8 hour span. A subset of the CaMKIV over-expressed and WT mice were then recorded after trace fear training during the same time points of the next day. CaMKIV over-expressed mice were found to have elevated slow delta oscillations above that of the first hour of their pre-conditioning. However, WT mice did not show a similar enhancement. * is  p  <  0.05 compared to WT for the corresponding hour, # is  p  <  0.05 between pre and post-conditioning for the corresponding hour.

Explants of human articular cartilage were impact loaded with a mass of 500 g dropped from 25 mm (0.13 J). The culture medium from each explant was collected at 3 days and 6 days following loading. The concentration of GAGs in the medium was measured with the DMMB assay, normalised to the wet weight of each explant and expressed per mg of cartilage. Day 6 results represent the cumulative release of GAGs (combining the two 3-day periods). Mean values ( ±  standard deviation,  n  = 3) from three experiments are shown. Each experiment used five replicates in each group.  (a)  Impact load significantly increased the concentration of GAGs in the explant culture medium. Asterisks denote significant differences (**p  ≤  0.01) between unloaded controls and impact loaded explants.  (b)  The release of GAGs was unaffected by the addition of celecoxib or indomethacin.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Interleukin-17/interferon-gamma (IL-17/IFN γ ) ratio increases with disease severity and dependence on Fas ligand.  (a)  Single-cell suspensions of splenocytes from individual mice were cultured in the presence of 10  μ g/mL of cII 259-273  peptide. Culture supernatants were collected on days 2 and 5 and tested for IFN γ  and IL-17, respectively, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described in Materials and methods. The ratio of antigen-stimulated IL-17 to IFN γ  was determined for each mouse and plotted against the disease score for that mouse. Linear regression was performed using GraphPad Prism software and showed a significant correlation between a higher IL-17/IFN γ  ratio as disease severity increased (R-squared = 0.2539, F = 5.444,  P  = 0.033).  (b-c)  Splenic CD19 +  B cells were magnetic bead-purified from na ï ve DBA/1 mice and cultured overnight in the presence or absence of plate-bound anti-mouse CD40 antibody. After 24 hours of culture, cII peptide was added to indicated samples, followed by the addition of splenocytes from na ï ve cII T-cell receptor transgenic mice that had been depleted of CD19 +  cells by magnetic bead separation. Supernatants were collected 5 days after the addition of B-depleted cells, and IL-17 (b) and IFN γ  (c) levels were determined by ELISA. Data shown are mean  ±  standard deviation of triplicate samples. Ag, antigen; cII, type II collagen; FasL, Fas ligand.</CAPTION>

Univariate relationship (expressed in box plots) between average blood glucose (BG) sampling frequency ( f ) and glycemic penalty index (GPI) (top panel), duration of algorithm application ( D ) and GPI (second panel), APACHE II score ( A ) and GPI (third panel), and type of illness and GPI (bottom panel) based on patient group 1. The p values of the null hypothesis that the GPI medians per group are equal are mentioned in each panel. A significant difference was found for the average BG sampling frequency and the duration of algorithm application. The longer the algorithm is applied to the patient and the longer the time intervals between successive measurements, the tighter the glycemic control (lower GPI). The apparently contradictory impact of the BG sampling frequency on GPI can be explained by the negative correlation between the variables duration of algorithm application and average BG sampling frequency (see text).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Identification of structural parameters that predict mRNA polysome loading in wild type and  eif3h  mutants. The average translation state of mRNAs was plotted separately for wild-type and  eif3h  mutant plants after subdividing the transcriptome (5,101 genes with polysome loading data and full-length cDNA support) according to the following parameters:  (a)  number of uAUGs in the 5' leader;  (b)  the  eif3h  mutation did not cause a global reduction in mRNA transcript levels for uORF-containing mRNAs;  (c)  length of the 5' leader in nucleotides (nt);  (d)  similar to (c), but leaders were classified into subgroups according to the number of uORFs. For clarity, we plotted only the difference in translation state between  eif3h  and wild type (colored lines). The stippled line denotes the percentage of leaders in each length class (cumulative).  (e)  Length of the 3' untranslated region.  (f)  Length of the protein-coding region of the main ORF. Standard errors are shown. The asterisk indicates a significant difference between the translation state in wild type and  eif3h  mutant ( p  <  0.05) according to a  t -test (unpaired, two-tail).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Receiver operating characteristics . To assess the ability of the proposed method to detect genomic regions with biased gene expression, we determined its ROC curve for different SNRs, aberration sizes and proportions of non-influenced genes (Materials and methods and also Figure 1). This figure ( π   = 0.1) represents an excerpt from the full set of results (Additional file 1). Key observations: (1) the proposed method exhibits stronger detection performance than the control method (CGHseg); (2) the improvement is present throughout, but is particularly pronounced for low to intermediate SNRs. We conclude that the proposed method exhibits a better trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, especially under expression data-like conditions.</CAPTION>

Healthy lung segments (ROI 2 and 3) demonstrate a linear increase in relaxivity (= 1/T1) with increasing oxygen concentrations. The slope of the  curve is a measurement of lung oxygen transport capacity. The diseased lung segment (ROI 1) shows no rise; there is therefore no oxygen transport.</CAPTION>

Proximal targets of probes 1 and 2 (arrowheads) in BP1 share 99% sequence identity to their distal BP3 targets (arrowheads). Probes 3, 4, 7, 8 and 10 are adjacent to duplicon regions. LC probes 5 and 6 mimic SC probes as each have one paralog target in BP2 and their other paralogs are divergent and distal of 15q11.2q13 or interchromosomal (see text). Probe 9 serves as a deletion control that targets a sequence ~20 Kb centromeric of  MAGEL2 . Probe lengths are reported in base pairs (bp). B) Metaphase FISH algorithm for delineating Class I and Class II deletions in 15q11.2q13. Probes 1 through 10 are color-coded. A schema of hybridization experiments is shown for Class I and II deletions. Different outcomes indicated by the presence (+) or absence (-) of an SC (green) or LC probe (red) prescribes the procedure for delineating boundaries of a breakage interval (unfilled box). If two paralogous LC targets are retained; this is indicated by a '++' symbol. Further refinement of a deletion interval requires either sequential application of additional SC probes or dual-color/dual-probe hybridization.</CAPTION>

A) Western blot of midgut epithelium (MgEp) and food bolus protein extracts obtained from blood fed mosquitoes at 24 hr PBM using antibodies specific for AaSPVI, AaSPVII, and AaLT as previously described [ 13 ]. Each lane contains protein from 0.2 midgut equivalents obtained from pooled blood fed mosquitoes. Note that it is not possible to use a protein loading control for these two extracts because the amount of protein differs by  > 5-fold (MgEp versus food bolus), and moreover, the MgEp proteins are from mosquito origin and the food bolus proteins are from bovine origin. B) Amino acid sequence of the nascent polypeptide (zymogen) for the four mosquito serine proteases (AaET, AaSPVI, AaSPVII, AaLT) and bovine trypsin (BvT). The protein leader sequence was predicted by SignalP 3.0, whereas the propeptide sequence was defined as the sequence between the leader sequence C-terminus and the N-terminus of the mature form of the proteases based on the known amino acid sequence of the BvT mature form. The predicted propeptide cleavage site is shown. C) Amino acid sequence of the Mek forms of the four recombinant mosquito proteases showing the engineered EK propeptide sequence.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Efficient target gene silencing with reduced OAS1 induction and lower shRNA expression.  Total RNA was isolated from IS-1 cells (CTRL) or IS-1 cells 4 days after transduction with U6PT, sh319 or sh321 vectors. After reverse transcription, cDNA was analysed for expression of PAI-2 (A) and OAS1 (B). Data were generated by QRT-PCR, each target gene was detected in triplicate, error bars represent the standard deviation of mean values. 1 ml or 0.1 ml of each lentiviral vector stock was used, hence the designations 1 and 0.1. Vector titres were approximately 10 6  transducing units per ml resulting in a multiplicity of transduction of approximately 10 for 1 ml used or 1 for 0.1 ml used. In C, shRNA expression was detected in total cell RNAs using a modified RNase protection protocol. Total RNA was mixed with radiolabelled probes for hybridization and RNase protection. Samples were resolved on a 15 % Acrylamide/8M Urea/TBE gel and RNase protected probes detected by autoradiography. Lane 1 shows the Mir-16 probe without RNase digestion or target RNA, lane 2 is as lane 1 with RNase digestion and lane 3 as lane 2 with U6PT-transduced cell RNA as hybridization target. Lane 4 shows the sh3 probe without RNase digestion or target RNA, lane 5 as lane 4 with RNase digestion and lane 6 as lane 5 with U6PT-transduced cell RNA as hybridization target. In lane 7 sh321-transduced cell RNA was used as the hybridization target for the sh3 probe with RNase digestion, and lane 8 is as lane 7 except that cells were transduced with 10-fold less vector titre (sh321 1 and sh321 0.1). Known nucleotide lengths (Ntds.) for the probes and the protected Mir-16 endogenous RNA are marked.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>ATF3 expression in myoepithelial cells of BK5.ATF3 mice . (a). A paraffin section (4  μ m) of a mammary gland from an 8 week old BK5.ATF3 virgin female was stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies to CK5 (Texas Red, red) and CK8 (FITC, green) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. (b-e). Sections were also treated with a primary antibody to ATF3, then stained using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and a chromogenic substrate that produces a brown stain, and counterstained with hematoxylin. Mammary gland from a BK5.ATF3 transgenic female (b,d) was compared with a non-transgenic littermate (c,e). Scale bars = 100  μ m; scale bar in panel c applies to panels b and c, scale bar in panel e applies to panels d and e. (f). Nuclear extracts were analyzed for ATF3 protein expression by immunoblotting as described in Materials and Methods. Equal amounts of protein from mammary glands of non-transgenic mice (lane WT) or BK5. ATF3 mice of line 1 (lane 1), line 2 (lane 2), line 3 (lane 3), or line 4 (lane 4) were analyzed. As a positive control, an extract from RAW 264.7 cells was analyzed (lane C).  β -actin was used as loading control. An ATF3-specific band was detected in the 20 – 25 KD size range in the BK5.ATF3 mammary gland extracts and in the positive control extract; this band was barely detectable in extracts from non-transgenic mice (lane 1). The ATF3 band was abolished by preincubation with the ATF3 blocking peptide (not shown).</CAPTION>

All reactions were amplified with the ABI Gene Expression Master-mix (containing UNG). b) The same experiment was conducted except the NEB Taq Polymerase and buffer was used (no UNG in the PCR for both generation of the primer-dimers and subsequent PCR). NEB Taq is less efficient than ABI Taq at amplifying the target for the lower band in the PSMA transgene PCR, however inhibition by contaminating primer-dimers is the same regardless of PCR mix. c) The PSMA transgene PCR product and negative control were amplified with the ABI Gene Expression Master-mix and gel purified to remove primer-dimers. These products as well as non-purified PSMA transgene PCR product and negative control (that contain primer-dimers) were used to contaminate a subsequent PSMA transgene PCR. The results indicate that amplification of legitimate PCR target is significantly inhibited by contamination with previously generated negative control reactions using the same primers, regardless of the presence or absence of UNG. It also indicates that the UNG degradation products can weakly inhibit amplification and the UNG degradation products and primer-dimers can completely inhibit PCR amplification.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Analysis of osteopontin (OPN) expression and cell migration in Met-As and Db-S stable cell lines.  (a)  Detergent lysates were prepared from the indicated cell lines. Proteins were size-fractionated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidenedifluoride membrane and analyzed for OPN expression with antimouse antibody (AF808; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). OPN migrated as a doublet, presumably due to isoforms generated by different levels of glycosylation (arrows). Molecular mass standards are indicated on the left-hand side. The lowermost band present in all four lanes is due to nonspecific binding.  (b)  Relative OPN expression and  (c)  the fold change in OPN expression in Met-As cells and Db-S cells compared with their relevant vector-transfected control cell lines were determined in the blot in (a) using the TotalLab version 2.00 software package (NonLinear Dynamics, Ltd, Durham, NC, USA).  (d)  Migration assays were performed on the Db-S cells, Met-As cells, Db control cells, and Met control cells. Met-As cells showed a threefold decrease ( P  <  0.001) in the number of cells that migrated in comparison with the Met control cells. Db-S cells showed a 10-fold increase ( P  = 0.001) in migration when compared with the Db control cells.</CAPTION>

A brief glance at the black branches (indicating presence of tonal sounds/whistles and 'complex' sociality) on each side does not suggest detailed correspondence of acoustic structure with sociality. In other words whistles have a different phylogenetic distribution than does complex sociality etc, indicating that their co-evolutionary history (if any) may be more complicated than previously thought.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>YY1 binding sites within the ORFs of the olfactory receptor and histone 4 gene families . Four examples of olfactory receptor genes and histone 4 genes are shown with the location and direction of their YY1 binding sites. Large gray boxes indicate open reading frames (ORFs) of these single exon genes. Boxes above each ORF show forward direction (empty box) and reverse direction (filled box) of the YY1 binding sites. The arrows in each ORF represent transcriptional directions. The bottom plot shows amino acid sequence identity for all members of each family. A total of 1,178 olfactory receptor proteins have 35% sequence identity (the four shown have 52%) while six genes of the histone 4 family share 95% identity. Conservation of position of YY1 binding sites is non-existent in olfactory genes while it is perfectly preserved in the histone 4 gene family. Directional bias in olfactory genes reflected in the figure is consistent with the complete dataset which yields 3.4 forward sites for every reverse site per 1 kb. The dipeptides encoded by the core motif of the YY1 binding site are identical for all six homologs of the histone 4 gene family (four shown). Olfactory receptor genes, by contrast, have a high number of YY1 binding sites that do not correlate to the position of these dipeptides.</CAPTION>

Cattle BAC AC146804 [25]  aligned to the same region using BLAT (regions of similarity shown with vertical bars). A track for human proteins is shown to demonstrate that there are no known human homologs in this region. A scaled track for cattle ESTs (partial representation of "squish mode" due to the large number of ESTs) shows high support for alternatively spliced cattle transcripts encoded in this region. Bottom panel (B). A modified image from the UCSC human genome browser (May 2004, Hg17) showing the  in silico  anchoring of BTC1_14RD, represented as a block arrow, to a subtelomeric region of HSA19q on the basis of flanking sequence similarity in cattle BAC AC146804. This region is syntenic to a segment of BTA18 (shown as a separate track at the top). BTC1_130FL anchors in the same region (not shown to maintain clarity of the figure). The assumptive map location of the gene encoding the artiodactyl-specific transcript  Ast1  [GenBank: AY427788 ] is also shown. No significant flanking match was identified in Contig455 (due to its shorter length). Unmodified UCSC Genome Browser tracks for known human proteins, Genscan genes, retroposed genes, conserved sequences, and segmental duplication are shown.</CAPTION>

Probes 5 – 8 (green outline) are distant from the rest of the probes in the set, creating a white cross in the symmetric matrix. The rest of the probes are all in high agreement with each other with short distances between expression vectors. Bottom Right: Log2 signal intensity of the replicates. The signal intensities of the misbehaving probes, outlined in green, do not show the same high degree of separability between the control and treatment groups that is exhibited by the rest of the probes. The signal intensity graph confirms that these probes behave differently and should form their own cluster, as found in the heatmap.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Specific silencing of hSpt5 expression by RNAi . (A) hSpt5 mRNA is 3261 nucleotides in length. siRNA targeting sequence for hSpt5 was selected from position 407 to 427 relative to the start codon. As a specific control, mutant siRNA containing 2 nucleotide mismatches (underline) between the target mRNA and the antisense of siRNA at the hypothetical cleavage sites of the mRNA was generated. (B) Evaluation of specific hSpt5 siRNA activity by RT-PCR. Total cellular mRNA was prepared from HeLa cells transfected without siRNA or with hSpt5 duplex or control siRNAs and was followed by RT-PCR, as described in Material and Methods. Each RT-PCR reaction included 100 ng total cellular mRNA, gene-specific primer sets for hSpt5 and hCycT1 amplification (0.5  μ M for each primer), 200  μ M dNTP, 1.2 mM MgSO 4  and 1U of RT/platinum  Taq  mix. Primer sets for hSpt5 produced 2.6 kb products while hCycT1 produced 1.8 kb products. RT-PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel and viewed by ethidium bromide staining. RT-PCR products are shown from cells that were not transfected with siRNA (lane 1), or cells transfected with single-stranded antisense hSpt5 siRNA (hSpt5 (AS), lane 2), hSpt5 duplex siRNA (hSpt5 (DS), lane 3), or mismatch hSpt5 duplex siRNA (hSpt5-mm (DS), lane 4). Lane M is a marker lane. (C) Analysis of specific hSpt5 siRNA activity by western blotting.

(B) After HBV infection, the expression of viral proteins triggers demethylation of the COX-2 promoter by down-regulating DNMT3B. Transcriptional repression is relieved and interactions between HBx and C/EBP β , NF-AT, and CBP/p300 enhance the recruitment of the complex to the promoter, resulting in expression of the COX-2 gene.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Anti-IgM-dependent stimulation of CH1 cells leads to a poor activation of the signaling responses and induces cell cycle arrest . Panel A shows the histograms representing the distribution of cells in each phase of the cell cycle observed by FACS analysis performed 16 hours after a 1 h stimulation of CH1 cells with anti-IgM. An arrest in cell cycle is clearly evident here, with a greater than 2-fold increase in the G1 phase population. Also shown in the inset is the result of a Western blot analysis revealing accumulation of p27 upon anti-IgM stimulation over the course of time. Panel B depicts the activation profiles of fourteen signaling intermediates probed by Western blots (see text for details and Additional File  1 : Supplemental Fig. S1A) after anti-IgM stimulation. The plot represents mean value of quantified, normalized fold change in phosphorylation of the signaling intermediates in a time dependant manner obtained from three individual replicates and the over all S.D observed was  <  10%. Also refer Additional File  1 : Supplemental Fig. S1B for a detailed plot of the figure. An Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the set of early induced genes upon anti-IgM stimulation of CH1 cells is shown in Panel C. This network depicts the core module identified by IPA based on the list of early-induced genes used as the seed nodes. Here, the nodes in red represent the over-expressed genes while those in green are those whose expression was found to suppressed (Detailed key in Additional file  1 ). The canonical pathways identified by IPA for the set of early induced genes in CH1 cells and their corresponding significant levels of contribution by the early induced genes is shown in Panel D.</CAPTION>

The distance D o, c between  o  and  c  is given by the inner product, S i, j ( o ), of two spatial vectors, R o, i  and R o, j in MVS (Fig. 9a). The branching pattern of Fig. 9b and corresponding MVS representation of Fig. 9c in terms of S 11, i ( o ) and S 14, i ( o ). Here, the triplet of probes  o  =  1 ,  a  =  11 , and  b  =  14  were used. The endpoints ( 8 ,  9 ),  10 ,  12 , and  13  are degenerated into the positions of the nodes  2 , 3 , 7 , and  5 , respectively. When the pairwise differences satisfy orthogonality, the scatter plots are placed on the orthogonal lines A, B and C. Convergent evolution between the two branches ( 3 →   10 ) and ( 7 →   11 ) underestimates the pairwise difference between  10  and  11 , causing a deviation of point  10  from the orthogonal line A, which moves it to the position of the triangle.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Visualization of GPCRs by a fluorescent agonist (A; green) or a fluorescent antagonist (A; red) . Fluorescent agonists induce receptor internalization to intracellular endosomes as demonstrated by SK-N-MC cells, endogenously expressing the human Y 1  receptor, incubated with CF-labeled neuropeptide Y (B; NPY in green, nuclei in blue, bar represents 10  μ m). In contrast, fluorescent antagonists prevent receptor trafficking to intracellular compartments and target receptors at the cell membrane as shown by Schneider et al. using MCF-7 cells, endogenously expressing the Y 1  receptor, incubated with Py-1-labeled Y 1 R antagonist derived from BIBP3226 [ 112 ].</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Overview on local bone turnover in tumor necrosis factor transgenic mice. (a) Schematic overview of a healthy joint with only scarce osteoblasts (cubic-shaped blue cells) and osteoclasts (multinucleated red cells) in cortical bone channels and the endosteal bone surface. (b) In arthritis, synovial inflammatory tissue comprised of synovial fibroblasts (yellow spindle-shaped cells), macrophages (purple cells), T cells (green cells), B cells (dark blue cells) and other cells invade the subchondral bone and trigger massive local osteoclastogenesis and  –  as a reactive process  –  osteoblastogenesis. Also, osteoclast and osteoblast accumulation occurs in cortical bone channels but not at the endosteal bone surface distant from synovitis. (c) TNF blockade efficiently diminishes bone erosion and suppresses osteoclastogenesis in subchondral bone erosions and cortical bone channels. In contrast, enhanced osteoblast activity can be detected in both regions, suggesting an increased reparative response when TNF is blocked. (d) Receptor activator of NF- κ B ligand blockade inhibits bone erosion but not synovitis. Osteoclastogenesis is efficiently blocked in all compartments but, in contrast to anti-TNF, osteoblasts are also massively reduced. OPG, osteoprotegerin.</CAPTION>

The distance D o, c between  o  and  c  is given by the inner product, S i, j ( o ), of two spatial vectors, R o, i  and R o, j in MVS (Fig. 9a). The branching pattern of Fig. 9b and corresponding MVS representation of Fig. 9c in terms of S 11, i ( o ) and S 14, i ( o ). Here, the triplet of probes  o  =  1 ,  a  =  11 , and  b  =  14  were used. The endpoints ( 8 ,  9 ),  10 ,  12 , and  13  are degenerated into the positions of the nodes  2 , 3 , 7 , and  5 , respectively. When the pairwise differences satisfy orthogonality, the scatter plots are placed on the orthogonal lines A, B and C. Convergent evolution between the two branches ( 3 →   10 ) and ( 7 →   11 ) underestimates the pairwise difference between  10  and  11 , causing a deviation of point  10  from the orthogonal line A, which moves it to the position of the triangle.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Myf5 ubiquitylation is controlled by phosphorylation.  (A) Scheme of Myf5 E3 purification : for details see Methods section. (B) 2 ml of mitotic extract were fractionated as described in A; the fractions obtained from the UnoQ column were screened for their ability to ubiquitylate radiolabeled Myf5 in the presence of a ubiquitylation mix containing GST-Ub (see Methods). The reactions were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. (Ub) n -Myf5 indicates poly-ubiquitylated forms of Myf5. (C) The fraction containing the E3 was concentrated about 10-fold using a Centricon 10 K (Millipore). Untreated Myf5 (lanes 1 to 3) or dephosphorylated (deP) Myf5 (lanes 4 to 6) was incubated with the ubiquitylation mix alone (lanes 2, 5) or together with 6  μ l of concentrated fraction containing the E3 (lanes 3, 6) for 30 minutes at 25 ° C. Non incubated Myf5 was loaded in lanes 1 and 4 (START) as control. Similar amounts of radioactive Myf5 and dephosphorylated Myf5 were used.</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Genealogy for five sampled sequences illustrating how closed intervals, | s i |, and  Σ i | s i | are calculated by the KM (a) and KM' (b) models . The closed and open segments of each bar denote the available versus missing or ignored regions of its sequence as scored over the range of (0:1). | s i | are calculated from these scores (numbers next to branches) and  Σ i  | s i | is then determined as their sum for each  T j  (values on the far right). In contrast, the KM' model (b) rescores the sampled sequences and the ( n  - 1) basal ancestral sequence of this asymmetrical genealogy (the diamond) as  ∅ . Thus, these sequences make no contribution to  Σ i  | s i | as their | s i | = 0.0. The KM' model also ignores the first 20% of the sequence for the common ancestor of the two leftmost sampled sequences. This region is missing from the leftmost sampled allele and thereby fails the "below" half of the "above and below" test (see text).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>Inferring protein interactions via message passing . A toy example of the Bayesian tree model of evolution of interactions between members of two protein families for three species:  b lue,  y ellow and  r ed. For each species a certain number of experimental datasets is given: two for blue and red and one for yellow. Part (A) shows two reconciled trees for the considered families together with putative protein interactions at each level of evolution. The proteins in the trees are represented by ellipses (with color corresponding to their species). The speciation events are marked by horizontal lines and the duplication events are marked by filled squares. The evolution of the ancestral interaction between the root proteins (purple) can be traced down the trees to the extant interactions. Evidence for the extant interactions can be found in the experimental datasets. In (B) a random variable is associated with each putative interaction. A solid arrow indicates a dependence between two random variables which comes from the speciation event. Similarly, a dashed arrow indicates a dependence for the duplication event. Finally, dotted arrows represent an interface between the true interactions in extant species and the observed experimental evidence. The parameters  p s ,  δ s ,  p d  and  δ d  determine the probability of retaining or gaining an interaction during evolution, while the reliability of each dataset ( Rel ( )) determines the probability of identifying a true interaction or a false positive one. Arrows colored blue, yellow, red and green represent messages corresponding to interaction evidence coming from each of the species. These messages are passed up the tree in the first phase of the MP algorithm. In the second phase, messages containing aggregated evidence from one side of the tree are passed down to the other side (orange arrows).</CAPTION>

Blood type A cats have at least one allele that creates the depicted fully functional protein. b. An 18 bp insertion is homozygous in the genomic sequence of type B cats. This insertion disrupts the reading frame created by the -102 bp ATG, causing a TGA stop codon. Approximately 50% of the mRNA of the type B cat had this insertion. c. Approximately 50% of the mRNA from the blood type B cats had the 3' portion of intron 1 spliced directly to exon 2, completely skipping exon 1, including the insertion. Two ATG sequences are present in this intronic leader but are not in frame. The first in-frame ATG occurs at bp 139 in exon 2 for cats with this mis-spliced mRNA species. The insertion and G139A mutation is concordant with the  b  allele. Cats that are blood type A but carry the  b  allele had all three species of mRNA. d. The mRNA from cats of the rare blood type AB did not extend to the -102 bp start and did not have the 18 bp insertion. The traditional ATG start at bp 1 would be the first in-frame start site. Approximately 50% of the mRNA from the blood type AB cat also had mRNA species as depicted in figure 5c but not the G139A mutation as found on the  b  allele.</CAPTION>

Ca 2+  signaling depends on the increase of the intracellular Ca 2+  levels [Ca 2+ ] i , derived from extracellular calcium (Ca 2+ ) o  sources or intracellular stores of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER Ca 2+ ). It can enter through calcium channels operated by voltage (voltage-operated Ca 2+  channels, VOCCs) in excitable cells such as neurons and muscular cells, or through calcium channels operated by receptors (receptor-operated Ca 2+  channels, ROCs) in response to neurotransmitters. SOC's (store-operated Ca 2+  channels, SOCs), open when internal Ca 2+  stores are empty, and are generally present in non-excitable cells. Calcium from the ER is released by two types of channels, Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) channels and ryanodine channels. The first is present in both neural progenitor and stem cells, while the latter is expressed only in nural progenitor cells. IP3 is generated by the action of the enzyme PLC in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). IP3 acts on receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum, promoting the release of Ca 2+  from ER stores.

(A) In normal cells, the promoter region of COX-2 is hypermethylated, and transcription repressors such as DNMT3B bind to the methylated CpG sites and repress activity of the COX-2 promoter. (B) After HBV infection, the expression of viral proteins triggers demethylation of the COX-2 promoter by down-regulating DNMT3B. Transcriptional repression is relieved and interactions between HBx and C/EBP β , NF-AT, and CBP/p300 enhance the recruitment of the complex to the promoter, resulting in expression of the COX-2 gene.</CAPTION>

At low Pgal concentrations, inducing the  lac  operon products results in an expression cost that is larger than the benefit, resulting in a decrease of the growth rate. For higher Pgal concentrations the benefit will dominate the cost. Each data point is obtained from three separate measurements. c) The wild-type induction profile  Z reg WT ( I )  in the absence of Pgal, fitted with a Hill curve (Additional file  1 ).</CAPTION>

<CAPTION>SC and LC Probes Developed for FISH . A) High resolution map of LC (red) and SC (green) probes. Proximal targets of probes 1 and 2 (arrowheads) in BP1 share 99% sequence identity to their distal BP3 targets (arrowheads). Probes 3, 4, 7, 8 and 10 are adjacent to duplicon regions. LC probes 5 and 6 mimic SC probes as each have one paralog target in BP2 and their other paralogs are divergent and distal of 15q11.2q13 or interchromosomal (see text). Probe 9 serves as a deletion control that targets a sequence ~20 Kb centromeric of  MAGEL2 . Probe lengths are reported in base pairs (bp). B) Metaphase FISH algorithm for delineating Class I and Class II deletions in 15q11.2q13. Probes 1 through 10 are color-coded. A schema of hybridization experiments is shown for Class I and II deletions. Different outcomes indicated by the presence (+) or absence (-) of an SC (green) or LC probe (red) prescribes the procedure for delineating boundaries of a breakage interval (unfilled box). If two paralogous LC targets are retained; this is indicated by a '++' symbol. Further refinement of a deletion interval requires either sequential application of additional SC probes or dual-color/dual-probe hybridization.</CAPTION>

Therefore, the hierarchy becomes visible in plots of GO-terms of datasets, which were not highly affected by a characteristic value of the PC variable. The group of unspecific terms was strongly correlated with PC1 ( Loadings  are marked in red). The correlation of the PCA variable with a PC is visible and allows identification of PCA, which are connected to the PCA variable. Identified groups, which were connected to a PCA variable in the bi-plot, were coloured according to their subcellular localization.</CAPTION>

Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparison post-test revealed that compared to neonatal ovaries a significant difference in follicle number first appears in the age group of 18 to 24 years. However, no significant difference was observed during the 20 years of optimal reproductive period, between females 18 – 38 years of age. Yet, the ovaries obtained from 40 – 50 year old females showed a significantly lower number of primary follicles vs. all other age groups.  B ) Descriptive statistics indicates plateau of the maximum follicle numbers (highlighted) during the 6 – 16, 18 – 38, and 40 – 50 age periods, associated with a lack of statistical significance between mean values  ±  SD  –  see panel ( A ).</CAPTION>
